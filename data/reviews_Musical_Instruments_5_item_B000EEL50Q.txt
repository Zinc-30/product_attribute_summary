Unique product offering new kind of protection from fingerprints, dust, oxidation, squeaks, or &#34;gummy areas&#34;. 2 or 3 drops on a cotton ball and treat several guitars. This is a thin viscosity lube that shines your woodgrain better than new. I don't like greasy feeling products on my guitars so Dr. Duck 2080 Ax Wax is designed for my needs. I threw  out my Gibson spray. Too oily. Dr.Ducks Wax is worth the extra $3. This bottle will last a lifetime. You could use it on your Johnson if you wack off the finish.
Dr. Duck's Ax Wax works great on all of my guitars, including my Nitro finished ones.  Can be hard to remove if you use too much, so apply only a few drops at a time.
This was recommended by a guitar repair shop, and I have found it is a well rounded product that all guitar players should keep on hand.  It will polish, and lube things like Floyd Roses.  Do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil?  Wipe them down with a little DR. Duck's Ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case.  The secret is always use the least you can get away with.  Too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever.
Use very little of this. Rub it on and it then dries like wax then buff it off. It also lubes your strings. Good all around product.
Does it all.  Perfect for cleaning and waxing guitar; don't need a bunch of different items; this does it all.
