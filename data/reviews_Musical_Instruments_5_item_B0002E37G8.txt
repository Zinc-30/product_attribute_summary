This strap looks really great and fits just as advertised........it's just that it gets in the way (for Me and my chording skills) mounted as designed and shown. I altered the mounting manner to accomodate MY style and it functions fine.(Looks great, too) High quality and compliments the Martin Name and reputation really well. I feel that it's a good deal and  recommend it!
For those of you going for the folk singer look, or if you're afraid of drilling holes in your guitar, this is definitely the thing to buy to strap your guitar.
I love this guitar strap button. It's a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in. I actually purchased it for my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pink. It works well for it's stated purpose and appears to be of high quality. The leather is nice and soft and the button fits snuggly into the leather hole. Check out my user name stinkylungs on Youtube to see a video I made of me installing it on my new uke if you want to see it up close.
Quick delivery and item is good quality of genuine leather. Does exactly what it's says it is a good  piece of kit for a very good price.
I got this for my Ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck.  It took a few trys before I could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put.  Even so it was a good quality button.  The leather is tough and will last for years.  It will probably outlast the guitar.If you're looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option.  Maybe if you have a Martin it might be a better fit.  But it's really worth the hassle.
Simple product, easy to use that works exactly as it's supposed to without costing too much. I got one for a banjo, Ubass & mandolin but of course you can use this on anything.
