I received a MIM Stratocaster as a gift a year ago. Recently, I noticed the occasional moment where no signal would make it to the amp. After tracing the issue, I discovered there was some play in the Strat's jack and the right angle of pull on the cable would keep it from making a positive connection with the tip. A quick fix was to bend the jack's connector end, but the root of the problem was substandard metal that had too much flex and would permanently open, making a minor gap where there wasn't that positive connection.I've purchased several Switchcraft jacks and they just work. Stronger, more flexible metal, easy soldering, good materials. It's a very wise investment and makes a trustworthy connection. Obviously, because the finish is chromed, oxidation can get in the way of the connection, but that only happens after a few years of use and can easily be remedied. If oxidation/wear is an issue, Switchcraft makes gold-plated jacks. However, I just love these jacks, and for the price, they really can't be beat.
JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR! THE SAME AS THE OLD ONE I GOT IN MY BC RICH WARLOCK NETCK TRU
What really can you say about Switchcraft, they just make good solid parts.  Grab one, drop it in and replace that old broken import jack.
Bought this as a replacement for a vintage guitar I am re-doing.  I've learned the hard way that there are some things you don't skimp on.  And this is one.  Switchcraft is what we used in the Air Force 40 years ago, and are still some of the best-made electronic components out there!
I didnt have any issue with this when I went to put it in my strat build. Not a lot to say about it really. Its metal and it works. Switchcraft is usually a good product.
