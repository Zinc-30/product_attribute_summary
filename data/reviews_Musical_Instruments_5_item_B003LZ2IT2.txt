Works as expected. Clips onto pretty much any mic stand. The movable head is awesome.
I have this pop filter clamped onto myOn Stage Stands MS7701 Tripod Boom Microphone StandThe pop filter is double layered and spaced out fairly well. It provides at extra layer to reduce the p's, f's, t's, etc. It also is good for preventing moisture and spit from going into your precious microphone.Surprisingly, the gooseneck really does not make any noise when you move it. The gooseneck is sturdy. It is flexible yet stationary.This product does exactly what it intends to do with a quality build.Buy with confidence!
This is a pop filter. It does a fantastic job at that. The plastic rings feel a little cheap, but that is just because they need to be lightweight. Ultimately, this is a great pop filter and the goose-neck is very strong but flexible. I would highly recommend this piece, as it also enforces a strong habit of stepping away from the microphone just a bit and not getting too close.
Works solid, looks solid, and had a good price. I would recommend it to anyone!I really like this pop filter.
This On Stage ASFSS6 GB Dual Screen Pop Filter performs great and makes me sound professional.  I particularly like the flexible gooseneck, which makes adjustments on target.Also, the filter arrived well packaged and in perfect order.  A well deserved 5 star rating for this affordable product.
The gooseneck holds its position well when adjusted into place in front of the microphone.  Also, the clamp works well.  However, the gooseneck initially made some snapping sounds when flexing it - that now seems to be in the past, generally; perhaps, it's a tubing issue.I have yet to try the pop filter with my microphone.
