I had done a fair amount of research on banjos before I bought this. It has many of the same components of a more expensive banjo and plays very well. Yes there many banjos and some with more frills. There is no indication of where this banjo was made, but the quality is top notch. I am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely. I see no flaws on my banjo. I did not have the problem with the 5th string machine being to tight as others. I bought mine from [...], the same place it ships if you buy it at Amazon best was 10 bucks cheaper with free shipping. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. I can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy. I also have very large hands with chubby fingers and was worried about it having a small neck, that is not a issue either. While I am expert on banjo I would gladly buy another and see no reason to spend more money at this point and probably not later on either. A keeper for sure.
So, I ordered this to learn to play the banjo, because of the price and good reviews. It was delivered yesterday, and the first thing I noticed was that the neck was loose, and the strings were easily an inch or more off the fret board. I looked to make sure it wasn't warped or cracked, and it wasn't.So I scoured the internet to find my problem, and most results said to tighten the metal rod in the banjo pot. So I took the resonator off, and found that it had an inch gap between the neck and the body, and naturally that scared me, but I tightened the metal rod, and it brought the neck down to the body, and brought the strings down to the perfect height.Now it's a very beautiful instrument, and it sounds pretty good too, Granted, It's not a Gold Tone or what have you, But it sounds at-least like a banjo that costs 2-3x this much. The only thing I would change is the tuning pegs, as they are made out of a cheap plastic, they don't feel like they will break any time soon though, I just prefer metal tuning pegs. (the part that holds the strings is still metal, I'm talking about the things your turn with your fingers to tune it is plastic)So, I'm debating on rating it 4 stars or 5 stars.. I'd rate it 4 because of the scare it gave me at first, but I think I'll rate it 5 stars because of it's looks, sound, and price. Yes, the reviews are right guys, don't be skeptical, But be warned that you may have to do a little TLC on it, as I did with the neck. No worries though, Now I'm learning my new favorite instrument. (Also, the strings that came on it are pretty decent, but new strings sound a bit better)
My banjo arrived a couple days after I ordered it. It tuned up very easily, and for me it holds tune nicely. It has a good ring to it. So far I have only had to replace one string, but that was most probably due to inadvertently letting it sit in front of a forced air heating vent.
&#34;Quality of this banjo exceeded my expectations. Great beginner banjo with quality components at a fair price. Sounds good and the action is smooth.&#34;
I PURCHESED THIS BANJO FOR MY PERSONAL HOBY AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A BEAUTIFUL INSTRAMENT THE QUALITY IS GREAT AND THE Playability IS GREAT ALSO, I AM A GUITAR PLAYER FOR OVER 35 YEARS AND I KNOW QUALITY WHEN I SEE IT. FOR THE MONEY YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE I WOULD RECOMEND THIS BANGJO FOR BEGINNERS, OR JUST ONY ONE WHO PLAYS JOHN R
BOY, WAS I SURPRISED AND PLEASED WHEN THE BANJO ARRIVED AND I TOOK MY FIRST LOOK AT MY NEW PURCHASE!  THE INSTRUMENT IS FAR SUPERIOR THAN I WOULD HAVE IMAGINED FOR THE PRICE I PAID FOR IT.THE WORKMANSHIP AND QUALITY OF THE FINISH IS REALLY FINE.  I .RECOMMEND IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO ANYONE WHO WANTS GOOD VALUE FOR THEIR MONEY.  THE PACKAGE WAS REALLY WELL DON E AND ARRIVED IN GOOD TIME.  I HAVEN'T LEARNED TO PLAY THE BANJO YET, BUT HAVE PLAYED UKULELES, GUITAR, TIPPLE, AND LUTE SO I KNOW A GOOD INSTRUMENT WHEN I SEE IT..
great value, good quality and sound. Very pleased with this purchase!  High value for low $$ risk. You will not be disappointed.
I bought this not knowing what to expect. It sounds just like I hear on tv and it sounds great.
I was disturbed with the price of banjos, until I did some research on the construction of them.  They're not something a regular craftsperson can put together without some serious experience.  At least, they wouldn't be able to put together a quality banjo.  But Jameson Guitars had put together a great banjo and an incredibly fair price.The tuning holds well and the instrument sounds great. I'm a guitar player and I'm excited to explore the different sounds I will be able to get out of this banjo.  It's also very good looking.  I love the neck and the back.  Even the drum.  Quality work was put into this thing.  I'm quite pleased.Now, I just need to get used to playing with 5 strings! :)
I have been online shopping banjos quite... extensively.  Ebay, Amazon, 3 dozen+ online shops, reviews from multitude of sources, investigating manufacturer home sites, etc.  I did the same for this banjo, and although there is actually very little out there about this particular banjo, I still felt very comfortable with what little I put together information wise.  And frankly, at this price, it gets my warmest recommendation for those on a tight budget (sometimes, you just can't afford 400+ dollars for a mainstream name beginner brand).  Additionally, mine came very well setup from the seller (aside from the inevitable tuning).  And its purty too!  I would also deeply recommendSnark SN-2 All Instrument Clip-On Chromatic Tuner... absolutely the best tuner I have ever used and makes the various banjo-tuning schemes a breeze.Be aware, in order to avoid possible confusion, Jameson Guitars is actually a sub-brand of Davison Guitars, so if you order and look at your peg-head and it says Davison (like mine does) and not R.W. Jameson, its the same maker (yes, I examined Davison's home site as well as the Amazon Seller's).
