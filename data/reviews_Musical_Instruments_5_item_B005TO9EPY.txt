I bought this to add into the Axess MP1504-BLK Professional Dual Wireless Microphone I bought for home Karaoke use for my kids 6 and under. The microphone could not pick-up voice until it is about an inch close to your mouth. When you have it close to your mouth, it does sounds well enough that my kids enjoy. I added this screen to protect the microphone from getting damage or wet when it falls or when my kids touches the microphone to their mouth. Since this package came with 5 screen, I can wash it when it gets dirty and use the reserve to always have a clean microphone for my kids.The quality of the screen is very good. I believe that it can withstand abuse and will be able to handle frequent wash without ruining the material.
There is not much you can say about these other than they fit my Behringer ULTRAVOICE XM1800S just fine.  I don't sound to muffled with them on either - the colors made my Podcasting team bicker over who was getting which one.  I won't hold it against these Windscreens.
We use these on our wireless microphones and they have very vibrant color and easy for us to determine which microphone is associated with which volume dial on the amplifier.
The product is here and I am glad the size is right. The colors punch out nice and will1. Help my vocal mics last longer so singers don't drool on my mics.and2. Help out during soundcheck. &#34;Hey, can we get blue turned down a little?&#34;Products were intact but on an quick examination I saw small tears in the foam. I will update if that matters in the long run.
What I like about these spongy little things, besides protecting the internals of the mic, is that you can pick a color that reflects your mood according to the song you're singing. Just like a pink jail cell works to impart a sense of calm to the incarcerated, so too can a colorful mic cover. And my neighbor kids just love 'em during our singalongs!
