Put these on my PRS SE 245 and I love em. I can restring in a matter of a minute or maybe 2. They were a perfect fit. No problems whatsoever.
I have purchased two sets of the Mini Locking Rotomatics.  No more winding string wraps around the tuning post. Fastest string change ever. Insert string, wind about a half turn, and the string is locked in the tuner. No more slipping out of tune. Rotomatics will go on every guitar build I do.
Use these to replace the garbage machines that came on my (older model) Gold Tone banjo ukulele. Smooth as silk, work great - as all GROVERS do!
These really are direct replacements for the PRS SE line. Only the machine heads are somewhat smaller. A great product.
Super nice locking tuners. Used these as a direct drop in replacement for my Paul Reed Smith SE245 and really helped with tuning and stability. The smaller tuner buttons looked a little strange at first, but once installed looks great and works great.
They call these mini tuners, but to me they are just right. Some tuners are too big and bulky looking imho. I installed them on a PRS SE Santana in just a few minutes. They were direct drop ins. To use them you simply grab the top and turn it until it clicks. Then you line the hole up with the center of the headstock, insert the string and then turn the tuning peg. You'll feel it &#34;lock in&#34; then about another quarter turn and the string is in tune. They are really good tuners and I think anyone will be pleased with the tuning stability they offer.
