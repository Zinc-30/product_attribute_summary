Amazing strings, they last longer feel better on the bends than any other. They have a smoother feel and a nice bright sound.
I ordered the polyweb strings on the advice of some friends.  They didn't care at all for nanowebs which are widely available, but swore by the quality of the polywebs.  By some sort of mixup I got nanowebs by mistake.  I requested a return to get the proper item, and the seller offered to send me the polywebs and told me to keep the nanowebs for the trouble.  I haven't had a chance to test either set of strings out but I'm sure they'll be great.It's my understanding that the polywebs could practically be the last set of strings you ever buy (with some proper care).  I've been told that while nanowebs last longer than normal strings, they don't measure up to the polywebs.
I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned, sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned, sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED
A bit more expensive then other strings,  But theire worth it,  the tone is outstanding,  They last a long time,  they never rally come out of tune..... and they do last 3x5times longer then any other string I've tryed.  The sustain is great they give a nice soth blusey thone, Not to dark not to bright Just perfect.These string's are worth it!
elixir makes the best guitar strings, electric and acoustic.  they last forever and don't rust.  they sound awesome.  get them.
