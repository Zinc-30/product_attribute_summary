I replaced the older strings in my acoustic guitar.  While these strings are a bit harder to play (they are not forgiving on the fingertips of people just learning how to play) they do sound great. A lot better than the stock strings that came with the guitar.
Whenever I played with traditional strings, my fingertips would turn green. This was because bare metal would react with the salt and sweat from my fingers and oxidize (similar to the Statue of Liberty). This corrosion causes the strings to become duller and worn out. The defining feature of this product is the coating which is meant to prevent moisture from causing this reaction. Therefore, your strings last much longer. Traditionally, the coating has reduced the sound quality of guitar strings. However, this product is wonderful! For the first 3 days the strings sound strange. But after they stretch out a little, they sound perfectly fine. My fingers have stopped turning green; proof that the product works! I have yet to buy another set of strings.2 months later:These strings have been great, but I do have to admit they do not last 3 to 5 times as long as advertised. They last about twice as long.
These are outstanding strings that sound great; just a littler softer (to my ears) than the standard Martin strings. They last longer and are worth the difference in price over regular, non-coated strings.
These do really well. I only wish I'd ordered the light's. I usually buy the Elizir, but I thought I'd give these a try. I'm sorry Martin, but I like the Elixer's the best. Just my opinion.
If you can't afford the best guitar on the market -then buy the best strings. I would highly recommend for any acoustic guitar.
