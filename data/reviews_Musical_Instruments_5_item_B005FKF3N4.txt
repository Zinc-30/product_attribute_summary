It works and cleans the strings, but its durability is a little low, for about 2 months. I recommend Planet Waves String Cleaner if you plan to use a really good cleaner.
This has been a very good purchase, I have not stopped using it since I got it, good and prompt service as well Thanks again Cheers !!!
bought because cheap and trying to keep my electric guitar strings in good shape if I decide to pick it up again.
Used on my acoustic guitar.Pro:Removes friction for faster playing. I noticed immediate result after applying first time.Enhances string life and tone. Strings sound brighter now. I guess there was some mild crud buildup you can't see.Reduces finger noise. Not completely gone but lessened.Easy to use applicator. Wide applicator makes it easy to put on and not get it onto the fret board.Con:Packaged in a metal tin and the applicator went dry after 3 weeks. Has no seal and the little cap on the applicator doesn't prevent dry out.I don't believe I would buy again until a sealed container is provided.
I have tried many string cleaners and so far this one is as good as any.  I like the applicator, and will just need to see how long it lasts.
