Great sound and sensitivity. Very well made. These should last a lifetime barring any physical damage. Made in the USA to boot! These may not be the cheapest but they are worth every penny!
these wires definatly change the sound of the snare, drasticly improving sound, as well as looks. very satisfied with my purchase
Shipped fast, sounds great and the price was way better than a lot of other places that i know of
Perfect chain for most rock sounds.Get the 28 strand for a thicker snap.I might try out the 28strand next year. I'm pretty happy with this one right now.The place I live in has corrosive air though its not messed these chains.
This is a excellent Snare Wire, used it to replace an old noisy snare wire that rattled on my old Pearl Snare Drum, quick and easy to replace, came with straps to secure but did not use them as I prefer string. Improved the snare sound by 100%, no more rattle, snare now has a very fat tight crisp sound, well made product that did the trick. Product came with simple clear to read instructions with pictures, if you follow the instructions your strand will work perfect. Great Product at a excellent price.
