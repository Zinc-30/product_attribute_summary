I don't know what I would do without this little shelf on my music stand.  I works on my non-Manhasset sold-shelf stand, holds my pencil/highlighter/flute swab & even occasionally a small speaker set that I have for my phone.  It easily slides over the lip of my music stand and is reasonably secure.  Very well worth the $$.
The plastic is pretty lightweight, but it is a big help.  I keep various guitar picks, clips, pencils, etc. on it which kept falling off when I just set them in front of the music.  Glad I bought it.
I am using it with a Musician's Gear music stand.  The shelf fits, but moves easily when moving stuff on the shelf of the stand.  It is made out of plastic which flexes fairly easily and doesn't feel as sturdy as the metal shelf of the stand.  There aren't any other options though unless you know some one who can do metal fabrication. It is a good thing it does not cost a lot.
This shelf is so convenient and so often used that you would think that it should come on every music stand. It just slips on to the lower shelf and creates a smaller shelf for pencils, pens, clip on tuners, capos, etc. It pays dividens in not cluttering up your book shelf so that items go spilling to the floor every time you adjust a book or turn a page. I love how a pen, capo, or tuner clipped to the top lip of the shelf serve to keep pages firmly in place until your book is &#34;trained&#34; to stay in place. A must have, five star item.
Piece of plastic with no bracing. Due to design, will not attach to stands that have a turned lip on the shelf (which is most quality stands). I used double-sided sticky tape -- problem solved. Gives me a place to stow my guitar picks, tuner, capo and pencil and as such, is an invaluable accessory. Worth the 6 bucks, just be aware you may have to improvise when it comes to attaching it to your stand!
