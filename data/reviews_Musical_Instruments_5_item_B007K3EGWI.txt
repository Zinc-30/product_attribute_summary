I've been playing and collecting ukuleles since spring of 2010.  Good news:  these Aquila strings are on most new ukuleles.  Bad news:  These Aquila strings are NOT standard on some others.  I was able to take off the old ones and install these in less than half-hour.  (You can get a tutorial to do anything on YouTube!)  They will stretch and de-tune for a few days, but once tuned, they sound, and just perform, great.  Good price, great product.  Order extra to keep on hand.
You can't go wrong with aquila. Amazing song, very warm strong tone also carries a nice volume too.Long lasting, made with quality. Improves the sound greatly on less expensive ukes in other wordsit can make a 50 dollar uke sound like a 100 dollar uke!
Got a new tenor uke and couldn't resist putting my fav strings on it.  Replaced GHS strings.  So far, so good.
need to learn to read, since I have bought two other sets with a wound C string,, so bought these because I was having alot of trouble with my tenor uku my wife bought for me for Xmas,,  have since made a new nut and saddle to fix ( ok bandaid ) a high third fret which also I have sanded down and now is lining up with the others..
These strings are great.  They are very mellow sounding and I like them a lot.  This is what came on my uke, and I wanted to make sure I hade replacements.  I got both hi and lo G sets.
