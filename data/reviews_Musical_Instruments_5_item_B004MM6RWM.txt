This bag includes several different thicknesses of picks so you can see which fits your playing style best, and the varied colors means the more vain of us can color coordinate our pick and instrument.
It was nice to have many types as I had no idea the thickness I would like. It also helped my boyfriend decide also.
It's a pretty great sampler to get a feel for the types of picks that you may like. I also prefer the feel of these over the plain plastic ones but thats just me.
Exactly what it says it is, comes fast in an envelope. Hard to mess up a pack of plastic triangles though. Design looks great in the light too.
I bought a bag of these various picks just to throw around our practice studio. Most of the band members don't mind them. Its great to have picks lying all over the place so you can grab one during takes. Recommended.
