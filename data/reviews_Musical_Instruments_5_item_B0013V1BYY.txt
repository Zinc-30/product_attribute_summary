Solidly built works just as a mic stand should..couldnt be happier..As long as I take care of this Ill never need to buy a new one again.
Works well for my needs. It adjusts and holds whatever microphone I use in position very well. A good buy. I would recommend it for light to moderate use.
I just used this for a gig on Monday ... it's solid, well built, nothing loose or floppy, it stands up straight (extending to almost 7 feet tall), it folds up easily, and is nice and compact when folded ... good enough for me.One further note, when I ordered this, I was thinking that I would be able to just unscrew the vertical section from my round heavy base (which is also an "On Stage") and screw it into this tripod ... that's not the case, as the vertical piece here is integral to the tripod base.  I'm not unhappy though, this stand works quite well.
absolutely no problems well built very steady and easy to carry with you. I will get another for my monitor.
I bought this with my mbrace ,and it seems to be pretty sturdy. I would think it would work even better with a mic.
I use this to mount my Stagg Small Musical Stand to hold a small format mixer for gigs. It's light weight and sturdy.
