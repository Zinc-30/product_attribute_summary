I just needed this for my new guitar. From the looks of it, it complements the instrument well. I am happy with it.
I used these on my ukuleles, and they worked well enough that I bought tow more pairs.  They hold a regular strap well, and work particularly well with the leather strap attachment from a Uke Leash (google it, those are fabulous!).cheers.
This is one of those products which is easier to find and purchase online than trying to shop.  Its performance is min/max the same.  I've used three with no trouble.  You can get excellent instructions and tips on YouTube.
Arrived on time and highest quality and have the felt washers to further protect your guitar... very easy to install, but make sure you drill a pilot hold so your do not injure or split the wood on your instrument.
I ordered two sets of these buttons to mount on two ukuleles - a concert & a tenor.  The buttons are good quality, look nice and are easy to install. The inclusion of the felt pad is important - don't buy buttons without a pad.Drilling holes in your instrument might be a daunting thought, but take it slow & careful and you shouldn't have trouble. Check out this rather entertaining how-to video to see the installation process: [...]For these particular buttons I used a 1/8 drill bit for the pilot holes. Snug fit but (IMO) not too tight.I matched these buttons with this strap:Kala K-STP-BK Black Ukulele Strapfor a perfect combination.
if you are brave enough to drill into your ukulele for a strap these are for you,  I was hesitant at first, but this did the job.
Easy to install these buttons on the guitar.  Well made and just what I was looking for.  Thank you very much.
