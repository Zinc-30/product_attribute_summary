Buttons itself are fine, however when I was installing it the screw broke inside the guitar (right above the thread). And I even pre-drill it. there is no way I can get it out :( so had to find real screw and drill new hole next to it (now slightly off-center now)
A bit wimpy, but so far they are holding up.
This was exactly what I needed and worked out great.  It would have been nice to have the felt pads included with the buttons.  I had to pay another dollar at my local guitar shop for the felt padded washers.
I ordered these strap buttons to upgrade some of my existing buttons.  I have recently purchased these beautiful guitar straps and needed new buttons.  These were filler items for a much larger purachse.  Thanks.
They work nice on the guitar, make sure you use glue on the on the wood screw when installing it .This will help it to stay in the wood and not back out .
They fit fine. Works as described lol. Comes with the screws and the &#34;cotton&#34; washers so you dont scratch the body.
Not an exciting item, I'll admit, but they work as advertised and I do love having strap buttons on my instruments.
What to say about this except that they mounted properly, came with the right screws and I didnt have any issues. LOL
