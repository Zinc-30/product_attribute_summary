It's a button.  It's not fancy, it's silver, it screwed into my ukulele with no problem, and it works very well.
One of the strap buttons on a guitar I was given as a gift was missing.  I was told that it would need some minor repairs, so all I had to do was replace a strap button and get some strings for it.This strap button was screwed right in the minute I got it and it worked like a charm.  I put the strap right on afterwards and started playing it and it hasn't given me any problems.
My Takamine guitar needed a strap button and this button does the job. The quality seems to be good and installation went fine.For those of you who are unsure about drilling a hole into the guitar, I would only recommend drilling into cheaper guitars (Unless you know what your doing, of course)
very quick shipping, it works perfectly, I was able to screw it in without and pre-drilling as well.  works with multiple straps as well.
Nothing that spectacular really! It did it's job. Was easy for my husband to use. Made me able to use a strap on my guitar.
In fact it's beautiful and totally functional. The only reason it gets four stars is due to the fact that it doesn't come with a felt washer to protect your instrument and I had to fashion one myself.  I'd buy it again but they should really include a washer.
Great Strap Button very solid, aluminum and is easy to get that leather strap hole slips in very easy... very pro.
The only thing that would have been nicer and bumped the rating up would be to send a felt pad with the button. I used a rubber washer I had and that worked very well. It was easy to install.
It's a simple strap button, don't know what else to say, I can't imagine a strap button not serving it's purpose. I hate minimum word review requirements.
