Rugged, robust, flexible. Couldn't ask for more in a momentary switch. Like all Boss products it will probably last longer than me.
I got this for use with the Boss DD-20 as a tap-tempo. It does the job well, it's a little big for what it is, but definitely worth having with a delay pedal
I got this for my Boss Loop Station, but it doesn't work very well.  I keep hoping I'll find something it DOES work well with...
No problem at all.Great quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand. Thak you very much!
I'm using this footswitch to control a drum machine. it does the job and i've had no problems with it
I could not beat the price. The pedal does what is suppose to do on my Dynamic Wah guitar pedal. It is well build and I can use it on other Boss and Roland gear. Also, it not to big. It does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board. Very happy with this item.
nuff said.works great.latest purchace is used as a trigger on my drum machineused the CODA kick pedaltrigger a boss sound moduleplay it all the timealso use one on my Vocalist.  and eff mute.  and chan change.like the option of NC or NO.  saved my gig just tonight when one of my Midi controllers lost it mind an needed NO instead of normal NC.
