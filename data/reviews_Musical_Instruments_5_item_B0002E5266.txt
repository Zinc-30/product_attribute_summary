This stand is solid built, and for the price you cant beat it. The only minor problem I have it with it is that it begins to get a little wobbly once you start to bring it near it's max height.
I needed a couple of extra boom stands instead of a regular stand for a couple of my cymbalsand set these up and I am pretty happy with them.. They could have been a litte taller, howeverthere pretty good duty and do a good job for the money.  You could do better however you willpay quite a bit extra.  I would buy more if I needed them.
Durable, yet lightweight and sturdy. And, the price is right. Pacific hardware is excellent, right up there with Tama. I would buy this again.
Decent stand as long as you aren't abusing it. With any discount item, a few shortcuts were taken to keep the price in line. I don't plan on moving it so it works for me.
This is a great cymbal stand sturdy, tight, well made, using it with a 18&#34; crash and does not move or rattle, amazingly well constructed stand for the price, going to replace my other flimsy stands with a few of these, great product. I am not a giging drummer and do not take apart and dismantle the stand at all, but it is a great stand for my studio/practice kit. Being honest don't know how it would be for a gigging drummer, but for what I am using it for, more than does the job.
You can compare this to a pearl or any other popular stand ,your just not going to have the pay that hi price try it you'll like it !
All of the PD/DW products I've bought have been amazing (from stands, to thrones, etc). This stand is an amazing value and provides a lot of flexibility when mounting your cymbals. Solid too.
