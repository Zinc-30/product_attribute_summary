I bought this hoping to use as intended, angled into guitar & straight into mixer, wrong, have to use it the other way around ... sad!
Only Lasted 2yr.  I have a lot of cheaper cables that get more use/abuse than this one that have outlasted it.
Plenty of cord to move around with.  Makes it less likely that I am going to clip the cord on a down stroke.  Just what the guitar doctor ordered.
excellent
I love this cable, they look good and are well made too. An incre&iacute;ble guitar cable, i really recomended it, i have the 12ft and this one 21ft. Try one.
