It's smaller than i thought, it works fine and it picks the string really fast. It does only tune in the regular A tune (so E, A, D, G, B, E). So since it's a gift for my father in law it works just fine, but since I use a A flat tuning for my Gibson, and even lower (G) for my Jackson it doesn't work for me.
This a great chromatic clip on guitar tuner.  The letters are big so you don't have to strain your eyes to see the notes when you tune.  Clips easily to your guitar and turns where you can see the letters when tuning.
I've been using this for a month or so and it works as described.  Some people rate this above the Snark devices, but I cannot.If I were to choose, I'd go for the Snark but this is still an acceptable tuner.
I have a few tuners that are somewhat like this GT-1 Clip-on Tuner. However this is the best one I have because of the format of the Clip-on Tuner GT-1. The size of the Clip-on GT-1 one is also great. So far the tuner is very accurate. in conclusion I would like to say that the Clip-on GT-1 is a good quality. However I could have got this product for a lot cheaper!
Tuner works well for violins and mandolins especially.  Little harder to read than I would have liked, especially in sunlight.  It would be nice if there was a sound feature.  One other thing that I had in mind, so I'll say it here.  the people that purchase these should put out a Model that Says BLUEGRASS, and this 'blue' tuner would be an even bigger hit.
This is one of the best tuner I have had, what a great value for a low cost.  Thank to all for selling this Guitar Tuner at Amazon.
Every once and a while I play the bass guitar and while I use the Snark for my guitars, itwill not tune the bass; this tuner does a great job of that task, plus the guitar.
