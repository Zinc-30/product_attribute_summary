Nice accessory, hold plenty of sticks, and the angle makes it easier to get to them quickly.
I brought this for my husband drum set. He loves it . It is made very nice . I&#34;am happy.
Sticks are well organized and always in reach.  This is a must-have item for drummers and the well-organized.  It fits the set perfectly and is quite practical.
Practical, useful for drum kit. Tilts to match personal requirement. Fits easily onto cymbal stand and, importantly, holds in place during performances.  Prof Mike Haller

This On Stage DA 100 Drum Stick holder works great and is super easy to attach. Looks good, feels good... don't know what else to write here to meet the review word count ;)
