This is a nice leather mandolin strap.  Fits fine on my cheap Rogue A type mandolin.  Amazingly, it is made in Canada, not China!  The leather is very smooth and flexible, not stiff like some cheap straps.
serves its purpose; worked better when I added a quick-disconnect attachment; quality finish, comfortable, and enough range to adjust as needed;
I am so happy with this product that after buying the first one, I bought two more for my bouzouki and for my octave mandolin.
This is a perfect strap sized just right for mandolin.I would have given it five stars except mine arrived with a paper label glued to the back of the strap, which when peeled off left a sticky spot on the strap where it would press against the mandolin finish.
produce is great price and good quality. it is just the right size to hold my mandolin while I play.
OK quality and certainly better than a piece of rope.  I found it a bit uncomfortable for sure but for the money it is worthwhile.
This strap is not only nice looking and an excellent product.  Well made and sturdy. It would be hard to beat.
