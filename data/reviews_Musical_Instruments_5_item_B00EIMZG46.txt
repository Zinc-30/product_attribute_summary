I was doubtful this would work but it will give you a fairly accurate reading of all six strings at once.  I do like that the volume is reduced when you switch it on.  The only issue I have noticed is that some strings it will read as slightly out of tune (1 red bar) but when you go to individually tune it you sometimes fine it is not flat.  So for me it is a quick check while I am in between songs, anything with 2 bars or more will get more attention.
This thing rocks! Best quality than polytune  1, lighter and best switch. Brighter screen. Simply the best for fast tuning
I had just purchased a Polytune about 6 months to 1 year ago, and was a little annoyed when I saw ads for the Polytune 2.  Mine was still brand new to me and worked really well.  But after reading and watching about the improvements in this update I decided to take the hit, sell mine for a loss of $20 and get the new one.  A GREAT choice.  This Polytune 2 is amazing - bright, accurate (strobe option), well built...did I say bright?...improved foot switch... It's just another example of TC hitting it out of the park yet again.  Highly recommend getting one of these, you know, unless you want to grab a 1st gen for a deal... ;)
I personally went with the pitch black pedal tuner. The reason why is the LED lights on these guys are small and harder to see onstage. The pitch black is nice and bold and bright. One reason why i almost got this thought is the ability to tune all strings at the same time. So its a give and take issue.
This pedal is great help on stage. It's fast and accurate, and with polytune &#34;option&#34; you can easily find which string is out of tune.
