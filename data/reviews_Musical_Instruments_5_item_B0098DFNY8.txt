Ordered a set of these to put 2 on my Ibanez and 2 on my Squier, they fit perfectly. Highly recommended.
If you are ordering these to replace one or two of your Gibson Speed knobs, you will want to replace all four because they are not identical to Gibson's.In all fairness, these could possibly be BETTER than Gibson's stock, seem to be made with a more solid underside, but the numbers are a little bit smaller.This is the only reason I gave them four stars.Fit perfectly on CTS potentiometers and if you replace all four of them, nobody except you will know! -lol.All four of mine were fine with no apparent flaws or defects, as opposed to other reviews.If you get these and they aren't perfect...send them back until you get a perfect set! It's free!Hope this helps...not much else to say!
Not much you can say about these, they're knobs! They fit perfectly and are of high quality finish. They finish off my bass nicely as I like to have the numerals there for reference.
Not much to say here - they're knobs. They look good, are well made and fit perfectly on the CTS pots in my guitar.
What can I say?  They look great and were cheap.  My kind of product.  Bought them to replace the old &#34;vintage&#34; style knobs on my LP clone.  Much nicer looking!
