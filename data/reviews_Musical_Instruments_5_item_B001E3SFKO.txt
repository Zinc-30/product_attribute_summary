It's a pop filter. In case one wasn't good enough, they double it up! Works great. No complaints whatsoever. No need for a fancy pansy $50 metal mesh screen. This works just as good.
This pop filter does the trick everyone is blown away to see a double filter. It is still made out of plastic and can be quite easy to crack when trying to position but as long as your carefully it should last for awhile.
Pop filters already work great to block out wind and other unwanted noises from a microphone. And this with that extra filter on it, it blocks even more. It's simply amazing. Worth the extra few bucks to get the double filter. If I want I can blow directly into the filters and it'll block all wind from the microphone and will only pick up soundwaves.
Works exceptionally well. In fact, this works better than regular, single-layered pop filters I have used in the past and your sound is either not compromised at all or the sound is barely effected so that you would not notice.Well worth the money. The build and design of the pop filter is sturdy and can attach to a majority of microphone stands.
Very nice pop filter! I use it on all my condenser mics! It works perfect for those hard P's and strong S sounds. It's built very well and adapts to almost any mic stand. It makes DeEssing a lot simpler when mixing vocals. And it looks very professional! I wouldn't be on the mic without it, now that I know of the big difference it makes having it!
