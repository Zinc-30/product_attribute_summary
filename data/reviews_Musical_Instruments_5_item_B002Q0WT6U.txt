Bought this rosin to see how I would like it.  I have a very light hand on the bow, so I like a rosin that is on the aggressive side.  This is not.  Since all fiddlers have their own styles you have to deal with trial & error.
Jade rosin gives a extra grippiness to the bow.  It hardly generates any dust, and gives the bow that extra grab.  The only problem is that the effect wears off quickly.  I use it in combination with Motrya Gold.
What can you say about Rosin?  This rosin seems to be better than the cheapo kind I had and so I feel it is worth the extra money.
I have tried several rosins for my violin.  Of all of them, I especially like L'Opera Jade.  It leaves very little rosin dust on the violin.  Yet it gives you the tone quality you are looking for.
Very good rosin and does exactly what is described.  A nice finish to the other rosin with specific bows.  No need to try mix rosin when a new bow with the rosin labeled on the bow will reduce the mystery of trying to figure out which bow to used in different temperatures and humidity.
