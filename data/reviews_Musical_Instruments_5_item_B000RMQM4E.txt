Ha, Amazon rejected my first review because I mentioned a competitor by name (chickens). Let's just say that the price is excellent, much better than the competition, and the cables work great.  How's that?
These cables are good XLR noise-free cables.  With these cables, I am able to get good sound out of the behringer XM1800S microphones.
I am a pro drummer and run pro sound support PA systems for outside venues as well from time to time. It is essential that I have cables that carry the great sound we make out to the speakers to reproduce it acurately to the crowds. These 50 ft xlr cables are made well, I hear virtually no sound loss or distortion over the long lengths. And as usual dealing with GLS and Orange County, they came fast packed well and safe. I am a continuing returning customer because of quality, price and service. And though on this particular order I had no need to contact them, they checked in with me to make sure everything went well. Great folks to deal with.
I have had to use these because the stage was so wide you could not use anything shorter. Most stages in bars, clubs and restaurants are small enough to use 25' mic cables and reach the stage box of the snake, but not all. These GLS Audio cables have been transparent and sturdy for the 2 months that I have been using them on an almost daily basis. I have performed many setups and tear down with these cables and there is no indication of any problem coming up any time soon.
The quality is good (the smell was funny when first opened ... I worry about China's lack of environmental concerns), but the sound is first class, very quiet, so with my Rde NT5 matched pair, I have a very quiet signal path.
These are great xlr cables. We run them form our board to our mains and they are excellent! I have several gls cables and have zero complaints.
