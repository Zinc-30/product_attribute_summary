This guitar strap is very  comfortable and was easy to fit onto my electric Yamaha guitar.Very durable and affordable.My only gripe is that the color doesnt match my guitar as well as i thought it would.Colors are abit too flashy.
This is a sharp looking strap that looks much nice in person than in the photos here on Amazon.  The strap feels sturdy, and the material is just slippery enough to make moving about easy.  Definitely glad I bought this!
Quality strap that fits tight & secure on my signature Dime and matches the Dean From Hell lightening graphics perfectly.
This strap looks better in person than on the computer. It has a nice soft feel and doesn't scratch the neck like the belt straps do and the color goes well with a varity of instrument looks and colors.
I bought this with super saver shipping 5-8 days and it came in 3 so I was very happy about that. Also the lightning itself looks awesome and the black in the background is darker in person than in the (low quality) picture. One more thing is that the strap locks on very well by it self (I have a big problem with that because the strap that came with my guitar sucked) But hell this one is amazing. I bought this one for my black fender and I think I'm going to buy a white tribal for my white Ibanez Grg120bdx. Great product cant go wrong especially with the double sided design and the price.
