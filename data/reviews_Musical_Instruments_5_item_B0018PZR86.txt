its very easy to install and are very effective in locking the strap to the guitar! holds it in place and are of high quality material. i recommend it a lot!
Unhappy with it, actually I already replaced them. The method of attachment is poorly designed, it doesn't matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls, the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions. Expensive locks too.
These are nice strap locks, but the screw is hand tightened and strap movement seems to make it come loose. This can probably be solved by the use of a lock nut. Otherwise these are a good value with easy on & off.
I've read the revues and some don't do them justice. These fit very well, do the job they're supposed to do and if you know you have a hardwood guitar, just use a cordless drill to attach them, make sure you place the clutch at a low level in order not to strip the wood and have a secure fit.
It does everything it's supposed to do. I got these for about $12 here on Amazon. The Dunlop or Schaller versions of strap locks are usually twice that with no perceivable benefit that I can see.They lock securely, don't require any alterations to your strap or guitar to use them and they have different finishes to match your guitar's hardware.I have both Dunlop and Hennessy straplocks and I don't see any reason to pay more for the Dunlops.
