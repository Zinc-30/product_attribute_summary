If you are looking for a 100% leather mandolin strap, consider another strap.  The outside surface of the Planet Waves strap is leather but the inside surface is some kind of man-made material glued to the thin leather part.  I will be ordering the Levys "Leather Mandolin Strap (Walnut)".
Not that many good products/accessories for ukuleles.  This one is perfect in size and price.  However, you must be creative when attaching it to the headstock.  Just give it a little thought.  Overall it's fine.
Other reviewers have mentioned that the slot that goes over the strap peg is tight. They are correct, but it stays on like a monkey riding a motorcycle. For the bread this is a great strap. Buy one and see what I mean. My uncle played with a couple of old boot laces for a strap back in the day. Treat yourself and leave your laces in your boot...
It was very hard to get the hole in the strap over the button on my mandolin.  At least it won't fall off soon!  I just got another mandolin with no button, and this strap has no way to attach to it.
If you need it, good unobtrusive device for front or as a momentary back strap.  Leather or simulated, this was quite adequate for my purposes.  Price was right! Delivery was immediate.  Rolls up to fit in gig bag and no doubt would adequately go into the hard case.  This one is compatible with the finish on my instrument, since it comes in at least two distinct color tones.Planet Waves Mandolin Strap, Brown.  Also comes in Black. There is also an embossed model (Brown) offered at minimumly higher price.
