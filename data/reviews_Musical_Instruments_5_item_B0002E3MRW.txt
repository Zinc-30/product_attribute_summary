Not much to it, does what it should, holds a standard mic. Pivots in 1 direction only. Not the best build quality in the world (actually fairly thin plastic) but for $5 what else can you ask for? Should last a few months at least.
I got this for my wireless mics but they don't fit in this holder. I got the wrong size holder. Other then that it is a good holder
Not happy with the sellers description or the product. The description says "Heavy Duty" which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic Mic Clip, but it's not. IT'S RUBBER!!! It sucks. Used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly, and flex. IT'S FLEXIBLE!!! Who uses Flexible Mic Clips?!!! Make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead.
Its poorly made with attention to detail. I ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at Amazon. But they will not screw down all the way and are losse. It is useless!!! Other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine.
What do you expect for two dollars. I use this on a mic stand i got for my rockband mics. It took a little bit to shove the mic in and its just plastic, but seriously what do you want for two dollars. Its solid and it holds a mic, the seller had it to me in a few days  before amazon got me my mic stand  if your not a serious on stage rockin mother ...... you cant go wrong here.
