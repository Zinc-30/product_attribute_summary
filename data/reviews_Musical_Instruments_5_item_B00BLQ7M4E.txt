Throw this right in my little storage bag I use for my gigging materials...microphones, cables, straps, tuner, etc. folds up easy, fits great. Seems stable enough.
My classical guitar stand was metal and short, like this, but did not have the front brace or download slant. If I had this then my beloved flamenco guitar might not have tipped over and broken it's headstock on the hard flood. So sad. I mourn it still.
Solid, and super easy to use. The best for the price I supposeGreat quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand
You have just simply got to try this little guitar stand.  It folds up so small, and yet remains very stable in use.  Adjustable in a snap, but if you even forget that, it will grip your instrument better than a metal stand.  Anything can be knocked over, but this really works better than you might believe.  Goood !
I bought the wall mounts for a more permanent solution, but this lightweight little stand is sturdy and adjustable. I just move it around the house wherever I feel like playing. Fold it up to take with me when I go out of town. Everyone who sees it loves it.
