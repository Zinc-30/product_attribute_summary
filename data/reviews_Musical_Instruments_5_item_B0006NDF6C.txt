This is a really nice product for the price.  When fully extended, it becomes a little tippy, but I don't fully extend the legs which gives it a wider, more stable base.  Otherwise, it folds up nice and small for travel.  Nice product!
Good quality and doesn't cost very much.  The price is great too.  Glad I bought it.  Folds up well.  Has a black finish on it.
I enjoy using it and its helpful when you wanna use it to hold up your sheet music to a viewable point and your books too! I recommend it!
i needed a simple music stand to hold my music and notes when practicing in my room.  this does the trick just fine.  it is light, sort of cheap, etc., but it does what it needs to and it did not cost me an arm and a leg.  I wouldnt recommend using it for concert or stage performances but for at home, practicing, it is just fine.
It is a basic music stand, but it is sturdy enough to hold sheet music or books, does not wable and there is no play between the folding elements. You can expect to pay three times as much for a similar product at a local music store, great value
The price was right so I got one.  Does the trick for the beginner or for sheets of music.  Books don't do so well and prove to be top heavy most of the time, even some smaller ones.  Strictly for practice.
this is a great music stand.Very sturdy.Very well built.Just wish it came with a bag,then it could be put in the guitar case,but ill find one thanks
I was surprised at the good quality for such a little price. It does exactly what I needed it for.
From the other reviews I wasn't sure what to expect but this is a nice stand for the money. I use it and my granddaughter uses it as well. It is sturdy, easy to fold away and easy to setup. The leg spread can be adjusted for space if necessary. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a good valued stand.
