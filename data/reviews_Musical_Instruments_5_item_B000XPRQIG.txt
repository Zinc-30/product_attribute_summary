I have been using those webbed, nylon & sometimes cutting straps for years 'cause they were inexpensive (but not cheap). Don't know why I waited so long. Quality in this baby! ... comfortable too!
This is a well made guitar strap, and is exactly as described. Suede is of course less slippery than smooth leather, and 2 inches is fairly narrow. If this is what you want, then this guitar strap is perfect. If you prefer the strap slip easily, or distribute the weight of a heavy guitar more, then it won't be.Definitely top notch if this is what you are after though. 5-stars.
First the goods: Sturdy leather construction just cant be beat. the color is spot on with the pictures shown.The Bads: It's a bit short, I have it on acoustic guitar that the forward mount is the &#34;shoe lace around the head stock&#34; method, I had to max this strap out to make the span. I'm a bigger guy, so a smaller person shouldn't have this problem. Then there's the whole friction of suede on clothing thing I hadn't considered. It drags and pulls your shirt really bad, making it a bit of a pain to get the guitar on a positioned where you want it to hang. That problem is not specific to this strap, but the material its made out of. It's high quality, but I didn't consider it trying to pull my shirt off. If had to do over again, I'd pass.
Sweet suede. The feel of suede is hard to beat. This strap fits right, feels good, and looks handsome. Levy's is dependable, reliable. What more? Thank you.
I bought this strap for my Luna 12 string.  The strap is very comfortable and durable which is exactly what I needed.
The width is nice, wide enough to distribute the weight, but not too wide.  Attaching it is a snap.  The suede gives it a nice 'grip' to your shoulder so the guitar doesn't slide around.
