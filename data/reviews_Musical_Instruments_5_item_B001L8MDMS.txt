I bought this for my stratocaster build and it works perfectly. The holes lined up, it felt sturdy, and it is a genuine fender part.It isn't completely black though. There is a white stripe running around the outer edge. Not a problem for me, but it may be for some.
A genuine Fender part that looks great on my '10 MIM Strat. Good price and it arrived quickly as well.
I swapped out the pickguard on my American Standard to a black one so I figured I'd change the back plate as well. While nobody really sees the back, it drives me nuts when the front and back don't match. Because I didn't want to go without a back plate, as some people like to do, I picked this one up. The holes lined up perfectly and it literally takes less than a minute to install. You can't go wrong with genuine Fender parts.
Not much to say about this one.  It's a genuine fender trem cover, and it will do its job well.
Promptly received, nicely packaged with protective film on it.  Little bit of fiddling with it to get the holes lined up, but overall a very nice part.  Compliments my B/W/B pickgaurd nicely. Open slot in the back much more convenient than the series of holes, normally found.
The screw holes are just a shade off for my guitar, and you would think they would want to standardize so they didn't have to carry so many parts.  Nope, doesn't fit a Squire Affinity, just FYI.
Fit my MIM strat perfectly, not much else to say.  Always buy Fender parts for Fender guitars, dont be cheap and order china copies on ebay, they wont fit.
