My daughter has been using these strings for many years now and they work great. Excellent price and product is as described and price was right.
It was recomended that I get new strings when I bought my violin and these worked great. They are steel coiled so they were fine with my electric violin but did take some time to stretch a bit to hold a tuning which was a bit discouraging at first. They've been great since.
This string set offers typical D'Addario quality and value. I use D'Addario strings on all my guitars, mandos and my ancient old fiddle.
I prefer Shar's Overture premieres which are the same price.  These ones are a little too &#34;bright&#34; in sound and not deep or resonant enough.  Also bear in mind these are not dominants which are clearly far superior - but for which you would be paying $50 a set.
D'Addario Prelude Violin String Set, 4/4 Scale, Medium Tension is good deal for beginners. It's good enough, not expensive. Try it till you ready to by more expensive string.
These are a good value for quality strings.Strings stayed in tune after about two hours of settling in.I'm very satisfied.
I would recommend the D'Addario Prelude violin string set to anyone who want to use wire-wound strings.  They are durable and have a nice tone.
Um, if you're looking for budget violin strings, then you probably aren't playing principle violin in the New York Philharmonic. Me neither. I'm an abhorrent violinist, but I teach Mariachi Band to elementary school students. On my el cheapo violin, these strings sound quite nice. I would give them 5 stars, but I think that would be overselling them a bit. They're fine. If you're looking for 5 star strings, you're going to have to pay more-and ask someone who plays better than I do to review them for you.
awesome cheap repalcement string i would recommend them to anyone who doesnt want to spend 50 bucks on high quality strings
