This is my second Fender Polish Cloth. They are basic, but that's all I need for a quick wipe down of my instrument after I'm done playing. The only slight negative is the fact that they tend to unravel around the edges. Even though this has happened to me, it didn't keep me from buying the second one. The fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me. It gets softer with time and use. Overall I have to say that I'm satisfied with the Fender Polish Cloth.
i love waxing my guitars..keep em protected...these stay in every case i own...works well to keep finger prints off...should make a couple of different sizes...but these for the price work fine...enjoy
Great price on a high-quality polishing cloth.Not much else to say about it - it polishes my guitar very nicely.
Item arrived as described and on time - Way larger than expected, but my son loved it!  Says it's easier to use than the smaller cloths we've gotten before.
use the cloth often to polish my guitar. The fender logo makes it look legit.  Recommended to one and all.
This cloth is perfect for wiping your guitar down after a playing session. A guitar is an investment and you should protect it. A good polish cloth is a must.
