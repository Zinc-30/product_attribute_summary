Stable and precise pick attack. Excellent choice for the aggressive guitar player. I am buying more gauges too. They last forever.
Great picks, good to uses on lessons or situations that you certainly looses it. Very sheep relatives with the quantity.
These picks work well and look as pictured. The shade of pink is very close to that in the picture. I would recommend them.
There's not much to say about this pick. I like medium picks and this feels comfortable.They wear a bit faster than I would expect, but far rom being a problem. It may just be my style.The 12-pack seems a good balance between cost and quantity.
I ordered 5 different kind of picks and these were my favorite picks. They have a very comfortable feel and great sound!
Far too slippery for my fingers when I shredding and the tip wears out way too fast as well.
