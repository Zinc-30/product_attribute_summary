They say there the best there not wrong wool awesome good buy
Great cord for the money. Works well with the electric violin and mic my daughter got for Christmas. Will buy more in future
I highly recommend planet waves cables!  I have them for my guitars and for my mics . awesome sound great durability and reliability and warranty for life!! cant go wrong !
This with my Behringer XM8500 is perfect.I like that it is branded with the planet waves logo on the connectors rather than plain XLR cables Which adds a sense of a quality look my gear. This goes directly into my Focusrite 2i2 interface and I'm planning on using this same cable with a condenser microphone I have yet to purchase.
I've been using this mic cable for over ten years, and it had come up missing after an event. I looked everywhere I could think of, and thought I had lost it for good. One day, I happened to look between a ball of TV cable wire in the rehearsal room, and there it was. I didn't remember where I'd gotten it, or even the manufacturer. Although I have more than a dozen mic cables, this pliable cable, with it's own elastic clasp, was always my favorite.  I was ecstatic the day I found it, after months without it, and now have a backup. I highly recommend this cable.
So far so good! And I know if anything goes wrong I just have to return it to a local dealer.  Well worth the investment!
