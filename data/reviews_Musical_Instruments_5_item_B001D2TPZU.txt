this cup /bottle holder fits nicely on my mic stand and holds my water....(or adult bottled beverage) while playing. seems sturdy and doesn't get and condensation on my pedal board due to the neoprene , great product
There's not much to say about this product other than it can hold up a beer or water bottle really darn well. Mounting it to the stand took all of 30 seconds and if feels sturdy as can be.
This is an absolute must-have item for any gigging drummer! Holds your drink, just like it says it will. What more can you ask for out of a drink holder? No more wasted beers getting kicked over during sets for this guy (at least not unintentionally). Pro.
My musician friends notice, and wish they had one. As a flute player, I whet my whistle so to speak a few times during a performance, and this keeps my water bottle near by.  The cup is flexible enough to handle different diameters of cups.  I imagine it would hold beer too.
What can you say about a simple device that does exactly what it supposed to do. I used to put my water on the stage an 1/2 the time kick it over. Now it's right where I can find it everytime.
This cup holder clamps on easily and really holds your drink so you dont have to worry about it. The insert part is made out of thick material so it will smash down when you pack it up. You dont really notice the name on both sides at gigs, just a cold beer in front of you thats always in the same place! I love it.
In my band, we have a song where I use a kazoo for one song and I needed a way to store it until needed. This cup holder does the trick. It also holds my water bottle with no problem. The problem is it doesn't do both at the same time. That's on me; this is a good product for what it does.
