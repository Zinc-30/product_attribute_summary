Re-strung my Eko Ranger 12 with these D'Addario EJ-38 light strings and am again getting a nice ringing tone with good sustain.  No issues like breaking or dead strings that I had with Elixir's, just good sound.
Awesome quality strings! Love em! Just re-strung my 12 string. It was a hassle but I got it done nicely.
D'Addario is one of those manufactures that seem content with making a quality product for a reasonable price.  Their string selections compare very well to the pricer brands and I have yet to find a better buy.
Good value
I always love to D'Addario strings on my 6 string guitars so I decided to order these for my new 12 string Ovation 245.  They sound great.  Of course guitar strings can be a personal preference.  Over the years I have been experimenting with various makes and  I always seem to return to these.  This does not mean I will not try others.  I surely will continue to experiment.  I am one to change the strings on my guitars on a very regular basis.  I spend my Summer in Canada and Winters in Florida and I can assure you that the climate is much drier in Canada than Florida.  Strings on my guitars left behind in Florida for the Summer will deteriorate quickly even if they are in a humidity controlled environment.  I  find the D'Addario strings will stay in better condition than others.
Good strings
These strings sound great and so far have held tune well after a couple of days of stretching.  I have them on my Luna 12 string and the sound is rich.  I would purchase them again.
