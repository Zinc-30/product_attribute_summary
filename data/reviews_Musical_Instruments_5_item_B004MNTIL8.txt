I got this cable to run to my electronic drum set at the other end of the studio as a previous cable failed on me.  The balanced lead works well and the cable is very quiet.  Construction features too well soldered TRS 1/4&#34; male connections and the only downside I can complain about is the lack of strain relief...but nothing major and the cables work fine none the less.
A little disappointed with the cable.  Pretty light weight.  Don't know why it didn't work, just shorted out.  Luckily one of the band members had another one.  Wouldn't trust it again, so I returned them.
Good cable and has m et all of our needs.  As all of know who use cables, only time will tell whether they will last.
I was looking for a 25' TRS cable for my band room, I wanted a quality cable with reasonalbe durability although I was willing to compromise some durability for cost and I feel this was an excellent choice. Yes, there are better cables available at a much higher price but I feel this is a well built cable and great value.
It's fairly tough, but flexible.  No noise that I can hear, and the connectors look solidly-mounted.  I would definitely buy this brand again.
