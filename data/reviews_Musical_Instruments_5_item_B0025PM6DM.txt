Fender original parts can't be beat. The Philips head is an improvement over the &#34;vintage&#34; straight slot screw that a screwdriver can slip out of and scratch the finish. These look like the have a nickel plating and I believe are 8-18, or 6-18 size screw and are much cheaper at a hardware store, but I chose Fender original parts for the Tele I recently finished and for the one I am currently working on.
These are as described - these work with fender switches (which, turns out they include those screws), and fender pickups. Used them while building a few pre-wired pick guards.
They work and are fender parts. Even thoigh they work on many brands. Use them on all makes and no complaints todate.
It's odd to review such a simple thing as screws :-)What can I say? They're shiny and screwed well into the holes.
I have a 1953 telecaster body and after installing the screw to the pickup they were to long for the body . I had to trim them down
I probably could have found the same screw at the hardware store but these are OEM and fit perfectly. Recommended.
These work just fine as replacement mounting screws for  single-coil pickups mounted to a pickguard, though they seem to be too thick to fit through the standard holes in a humbucker (nothing that a little drilling out couldn't fix, if you're so inclined).
