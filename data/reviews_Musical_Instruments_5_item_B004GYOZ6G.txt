The tuner doesn't require you to hear either it or the guitar or bass to tune it, so it will work pretty well in a noisy/social environment. Overall, works just fine.
does what i wanted it to do and what they said it would do. works well with my stuff. recommend
This is definately worth the money. I was looking for a metronome and got this awesome unit that does it all. Bought another one for my friend!
I love the way this tuner works, with a bright screen and easy to use controls. The metronome feature is also a nice addition. It's a bit lightweight, making it seem like it wont last very long if even dropped once, but it hit the floor many times on me already and it's still going strong :-) This is a great tuner at an even better price, try it out and see for yourself!
It works well with several different instruments that I have. Makes tuning a lot easier and accurate. It is a good value.
I bought this after buying a red and blue clip on tuner. These are the best tuners for the money. The display is very stable and it's simply fun and easy to use.
