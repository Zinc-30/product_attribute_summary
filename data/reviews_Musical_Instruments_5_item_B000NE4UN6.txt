Just a bag for my guitar stand. No big deal, but it sure makes it easier when I have all that stuff to lug around. I love my Hercules guitar stands, but they a don't like to stay put when folded up. This takes care of that problem for a couple of bags. Sturdy material, nice draw string to close it up. Shoulder strap works just fine. Glad I bought it.
I love these carry bags!  They allow me to easily carry multiple guitar stands, music stands, etc, all at once.  Who couldn't use an extra arm or two when moving equipment?  Well made and a fair price, too!
Do you have a Hercules guitar stand? Then this will make transporting it easy. It seems like a gimmick, but I have two stands and it's nice to be able to grab both of them by using the bag straps, and still be able to carry more gear with my other hand.
If you have the full folding single stand this works quite well but the ones with the rounded neck that is one piece with no hinge are a bit tight for length.  OK quality but not as good as the stands themselves which are all fantastic.  I don't understand how people can spend thousands or even hundreds on a guitar and then buy an 8 dollar stand only to see their guitar fall over or get damaged at the neck.  If you pay attention to the prices you can really get some great deals on Amazon... untouchable deals ...
Tis makes it a little awkward to carry. Overall though it does the trick with giving me something to store my stand and carry it from show to show.
