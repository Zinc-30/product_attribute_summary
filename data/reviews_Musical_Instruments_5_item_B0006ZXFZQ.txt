Great for the price. It is a very accesible option and does what it has to do. Must have for solos
Doesn't color the sound, depending on how you're using it you can push the channel or get an extra channel.  I've turned a two channel amp into four with this puppy!!
This is a great effect. Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlop's MXR products has always presented. The true bypass feature and the high-end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable. This is very sensitive boost pedal that will deliver as it should. I actually believe this will exceed all your expectations. Ships fast. Highly recommended.
Excelente pedal!!! Es un boost sin saturacion excelente para las partes donde queremos que la guitarra destaque!! Indispensable!!! :D Saludos desde Venezuelaaa!!!
This thing really kicks it up nice and clean or real dirty over the top!I had a LPB1 that sucked tone and sounded like crap but I really need a line boost and didn't want to spend a lot for one.This little baby at about 3 o'clock setting does a real nice job for my solos and louder sections of songs.
