Very happy with these cables. Just finished cutting my first home multi track recording and they did the job. Well made and look and feel sturdy.
Good, inexpensive microphone cable. Even came with a couple of Velcro straps. The ends seem to be well made. Don't hear any anomalies in the audio.
Its the exact same thing as my &#34;Shure&#34; mic cable except the metal ends seem like they were made from a cheaper material. thats fine by me. They fit with no wiggle room and transfer phantom power as they should
XLR cables are hard to mess up...these are great. They do the trick. Why bother making your own cables when you can buy them already made this cheap?
this is a solid cable works very well form I can now walk around more with the extension no more limitations. Quality is excellent.
I purchased these cables for my Behringer 802 mixer & MXL 770 mic and these cables are perfect! Finally get to have quality sounding tracks knowing I have the professional cables to back me up! The best XLR cables you can find. Hands down.
I had purchased this cord and a 25' cord for an assignment I was going on. I had previously  bought a shorter cord that just didn't fit tight enough into the mic.  This one and the other one I bought were really a great, well made product and fit the mics tight and as they should.  I would recommend these cords and will look to purchase other lengths soon
These cable are perfect!!  I've bought much more expensive cable that didn't have the quality of these.  They even had velcro (re-useable tape to hold them 2 each).
