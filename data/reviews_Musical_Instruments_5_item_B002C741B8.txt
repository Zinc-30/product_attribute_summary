I agree with those reviewers who really like this pickup. It has a very natural sound, is reliable and amazingly strong. The suction cup issue is easy to solve, it just needs to be a bit humid and it will stay well. I also bought (for comparison) the Cherub WCP-60G, which is not bad but has much more of an unnatural metallic sound, plus it seems more feedback-prone than the AXL. I can only recommend, if you have a nice classical guitar and want to amplify it with true sound, the AXL is an excellent and inexpensive solution. I doubt that the $200 stuff is much better.
Got it right b4 x'mas, thanks Amazon!It is one of the best value I have purchased.  Suction design is great for any size of string instruments, uke, small soundholded guitars, or acoustic guitars. Thanks for the previous viewers' tip to moisture the suction b4 pressuring on the surface of the guitar that next to the bridge.  It stays great and pickups perfectly without any unwanted noise from the pickup wire itself (recently have bought another one does).  great value and quality for $11 i spent ever.
I bought this for a friend who plays the guitar. He said that you can hear the guitar but barely.
It does not stick on to the guitar very well.  Trying some of the other reviews as to ways to get it to stick worked but I now have a small circle in the finish of my Martin.  I made mistake of attaching so wife could play Rocksmith and now wish I had used cheaper guitar or better yet, bought a better pickup.
Works really well with all of my stringed acoustic instruments It has a good clean sound and I think for the price you can not go wrong.
the suction cup does not work. it looks like aged. it's very hard with room temp 70F. I removed the rubber suction cup and I have to use a big paper clipper to secure it on the sound hole edge. it picks up sound OK, but not great.
