Nice padded seat, well constructed. good padding for comfort, I go 190lbs.  Heavy duty base, lots of adjustment if needed. love Amazon, why shop anywhere else?
I've seen Joey Jordison from Slipknot playing on a metal folding chair before, so i'm going to say right off the bat that you can play sitting on just about anything. It's pretty hard to make a crappy product when it comes to Drum Thrones, so with that I'm going to say you're either going to get a great product or something that you can't even use. In this case, you can look forward to getting a great product here! The stool is very sturdy, no rocking, no swaying, no moving at all. Very comfortable... in fact, my girlfriend grabs it to sit on every time she comes into my studio to hang out with me. Worth the money, great product!
I needed a solid throne to replace my IKEA computer stool I've been saddled with for the past year. The stool is heavy, easy to assemble, and works as it should. I don't have any long term usage to report but I've seen reviews complaining the stool eventually loosens and will rotate which would be annoying if true. But at this fairly low price point you can't complain about much, and it's better than the real cheap thrones.
I sit. I drum. It works.  There's not much to say except that it get the job done very well.
I have found this throne to be comfortable for studio use and it seems to be solid enough for everyday use.  It is sturdy and heavy enough for the average player and the price is definitely right.  The padding is just about right and feels good and comfortable for the session times for which I have used it.  I don't know how it would hold up for touring or constant use, but it is perfect for my needs, as I am a guitarist who plays drums for demos in the studio.
This is actually a very sturdy yet light weight drum throne. The only issue I have is that the seat can swivel if not tightened properly, allowing the bolt to scratch the metal post (not a big deal).
