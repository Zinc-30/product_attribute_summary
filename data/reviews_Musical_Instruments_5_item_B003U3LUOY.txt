GREAT WORK MAT FOR ELECTRIC AND ACOUSTIC GUITARS AS WELL AS BASS AND STAYS AT MY WORKBENCH.  HOWEVER, I NEVER LEAVE IT ROLLED OUT UNLESS WORKING ON A GUITAR, TO MANY OTHER STRAY FRAGMENTS OF WHO KNOWS WHAT FLOATING AROUND IN MY WORKSHOP AND I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FALLING ON MAT THAT COULD POTENTIAL SCRATCH ONE OF MY BABIES!
I used it to whenever I am changing guitar strings and whenever I am tuning and intonating my Fender Strat. The surface is perfect (no rolling away of screws, no scratching of the guitar shiny finish, perfect)
I wasn't sure what to expect, and the foam rubber was a bit of a let down, especially when I took it from the plastic. Very strong fumes, not too pleasant, but they dissipated in the basement overnight.Because of the fumes I was a little concerned about what the material might do to a wood finish.  I was happy to see that there was no apparent smudging or marking after two hours.  I wouldn't leave it on anything "finished" for longer than that because this type of foam doesn't last forever and as it breaks down the residue can be hard to remove.  For now, it's great.It comes with a black nylon, sort of mesh tube shaped bag, good for putting it away or traveling.  For now I will just leave it as flat is possible so it doesn't curl so much.  For the size and utility, the price (which goes up and down) seems reasonable.
I thought it would protect my desk but the pad is almost like that rubber they put under rugs so they won't slip around. maybe i should get that for cheaper.I accidently bought LARGE, ooh boy is it; like, windshield sun reflector size. Sort of just a personal opinion review i suppose.
The mat is just the right size for your guitar when performing maintenance.  It is firm but is soft enough to protect the finish of your guitar.  Spills are easily wiped up and do not leave a stain on the mat.
I use this for working on my guitars mainly. It does the job well and is pretty large. It's very soft and padded as well as anti static.
A nice work mat of adequate size that provides a nice non-static covering for the bench.  Grey color makes it easy to easy to see small parts, etc, as opposed to some black mats where black objects are hard to differentiate.
