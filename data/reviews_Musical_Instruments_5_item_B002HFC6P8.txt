I used this on my recent stratocaster build and the gold looks awesome. It was easy to install and the finish was perfect.
I am proud to have this product. Fits my fender well looks amazing! Great quality in it also. I am pleased
Been ;'golding up' an 88 Strat Plus that has seen better days. Wiith the gold pick guard, tuning pegs, and jack plate - it looks like a custom shop job. This finished my hard work and I am delighted with the appearance. The goods are up to scratch and fit properly. Good service, product, packing and delivery time. Recommend them.
When you are upgrading your Fender to a gold package nothing completes the upgrade like a gold Fender jack plate.
I've had it on my strat for a couple of weeks now and it is holding up quite nicely.  Color is good and as pictured and it doesn't seem to scratch easily.  Installed easily.... Only thing that was slightly upsetting is that I only received one screw.... They shorted me a gold screw... Luckily I had extra and this didn't bother me that much.
