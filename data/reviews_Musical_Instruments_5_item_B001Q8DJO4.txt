really nice I found them easy to put on and to use on the guitar and easy to play. thanks
I've been buying these strings for a while now. They sound clean and crisp. The best part is the price.
Great for beginners and experts. The sound is great and is easy on the fingers.  I got them recommended by a friend
I like purchasing the 3 pack because I have multiple guitars and these were replacement strings.  You can't beat the price.  I have started purchasing a lot of my guitar supplies this way.
I am not a fussy person about guitar strings.  They either sound good or they don't to you and you are the one that matters.  I was very pleased with getting 3 sets at this price delivered to my front door.  There are so many different strings out there just go with the flow and look at the company logo on the outside.  Martin is at the top of the heap.  These strings sound light and bright. Very pleased with this purchase.
They are a wonderful product! The lighter the strings on your acoustic the less taxing to the neck of your guitar, with these you can't go wrong.
Nice light set of strings allows easy fingering allowing for longer play/practice periods and less finger fatigue. I would recommend these for anyone who likes the light and lively sound of an acoustic. especially good for beginners.
