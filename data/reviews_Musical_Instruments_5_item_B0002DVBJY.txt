GREAT strings!  Good quality and very good sound.  These seem a lot more stable than the 10-46 I had been using.
i play metal / hard rock and have used many different strings, these give the best tone and depth you need to play hard music
the best idea anyone who strings a bass can decide on. I am a fan of the Slinky guitar strings so I got these for my freetless Schecter 4 string bass. Like they were made for it.
The these strings are fantastic. The sound is deep and heavy, which is exactly what I was looking for. Makes the bass sound pretty bad@$$. I cranked up the bass amplifier after putting on these strings and the sound is pure, powerful, and blew me away.Well worth the money.
Feels great, sounds great, there's a little bit of magic in these strings. High quality classics add a touch of class to your sound.
