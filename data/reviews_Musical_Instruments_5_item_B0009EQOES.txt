This strap works well, looks good, and is comfortable to wear. The choice of colors and durable material are two strengths. Price was good for a useful accessory.
Nice basic guitar strap.. Great price and should last long enough.  I have started using the padded Levies strap as it doesnt hurt my shoulder like a regular strap. This can be a little scratchy
This strap is value for money. I was surprised when I got it - I didn't expect something so good at this price! The material is shiny, blue and doesn't look cheap and the strap is generously wide. The ends are leather with one side having a golden EB logo. Goes well with my black Squier Strat. Highly recommended!
No sign of wear and tear. and the holes are really tight, minimizing the likelihood of the guitar breaking free occasionally (it never once came undone in all these months, not sth you can say about all guitar straps)
This was my first strap. It looks good, feels pretty strong, and it is difficult to strap to the guitar. By being difficult, I mean it takes some time to squeeze it to the buttons, and it holds on tight. This makes me feel safe having my guitar suspended about three to four feet above the ground. You can't beat the price either!
they don't cost a lot and they work well.  They are inexpensive and they work.  I have purchased 5 of these for my guitars and they are nice
