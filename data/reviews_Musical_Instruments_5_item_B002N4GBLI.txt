This will give you the delay and compression that you need for country twang on the telecaster. It will also give you a rhythm track to play along too. The rhythm machine has 44 rhythms with adjustable volume and tempo. It is not perfect as it has no on/off switch, it reverts to default mode when you power it up, it is a little hard to set volume and tempo on drum beats. It only cost around $60 so perfection should not be expected. For practice and the home studio it is great.
After lots of researching I finally decided to buy this Zoom pedal, so far it has worked great, has all the features mentioned, lots of great options, also a great guitar tuner. For those doubting, you actually can just plug your headphones in the output jack and practice without an amp, which was an amazing bonus for me since I've yet to buy my amp. 5 starts, totally recommend it for a begginers guitar effects pedal!
As usual an excellent Zoom product.Adds to my playing. Just love this thing. Not too difficult to get the hang of. Even for me.
The effects are good but the controls and setups are clumsy and kind of annoying and after a while I just couldn't live with it.
I got this in the mail a week ago and have played with it constantly.there is so much in this little box! i was just interested in the drum tracks in it when i bought it but i have since stopped using all of my other effects and just used this! i highly recomend this to anyone who plays an electric guitar.
Just got this. It is my first pedal of any sort. It has many tones and a library of other settings I can play with. I just plug in my headphones and I am off in my own world when I play. I can change the sound of the guitar to match whatever I want, or at least get close to what I want. I see myself using this for a good while before I need to upgrade. This also came with an AC adapter, even though the box said it didn't.
