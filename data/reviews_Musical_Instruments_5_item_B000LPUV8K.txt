So, these ended up being the wrong taper for my guitar, but that was my own fault due to some incorrect advice.  Nonetheless, I put a couple in just to compare them to my old, plastic pins.  What a difference!  Unquestionably, the sound board was far more sensitive.  Sustain was much better and I got a richer tone, as opposed to the brighter tone some users reported.  I should say, however, what I got was definitely the true, ebony wood pins with the inlay.  I can't speak to concerns about plastic being used for the other pin colors.  While these won't work due to size, I'll definitely be making the switch from plastic to ebony when I find the right size.
Make sure you read the description of the color you are choosing. Most of them are plastic.I bought the ebony with pearly inlay. They look great, it is, indeed, real ebony with a pearl inlay.The pins are sort of an odd size (not sure if there is a generic pin size...), so they might work, and they might not. They fit one of mine perfectly, and another, not very well. I would assume they fit all Martin guitars well, because my experience with Martin is that their instruments are pretty similarly made in way of parts and quality.Overall, great bridge pins for the price, and they sounds much better than plastic ones!
I purchased this product to replace the pins on my Martin 0-16NY. I believe the ebony pins will be perfom admirably.  Additionally, the pearl inlay lends class to the guitar.
Really a nice upgrade...especially for the price.  They did stick up higher than the plastic pins, but I had read that they would.  At least I know that they fit snug.  Really look good!
Thanks for the prompt and good service. These are a quality product and really enhance my Guitar and I am very happy with them Thanks !!!
