So far this cable has worked very well. It has had no issues at all. For the money you cannot even make your own.
Cables are good, my only complaint is the connectors. The 1/4&#34; is not too bad at all, but the XLR end looks and feels cheap. I guess that's because they are cheap. Very good price and good performance. No wierd signal buzz like other cables in this category. Overall, 4 stars!
It's not as nice as my Audio Technica one but this does the job and I'm happy.  A little flimsier than the AT but at the price it's good.
Great price but very fragile.  I'm a 30 year radio pro always careful about my cables.  The end separated from the cable - not very good quality, would not buy this brand again.
In my experience these cables were not great.  The connectors rattle, they are made of cheap materials and the cable subsequently had a ton of line noise.  I can't expect miracles at that price-point but I certainly expected better. I avoid this brand of cables.
