I like the sound and sensitivity these heads produce for the snare side of my snare drum. A work of caution though, like all snare resonant heads, these are very thin! They must be to produce the sensitivity in the snare wires required. But you must be careful. I tore a small hole in one of mine with the snare wires because the end of the snare wires were too close to the bearing edge. Not Remo's fault but it is something to pay attention to.
I put this on my Cheapo $300 drumset's snare, with a Remo CS on top, and my snare when from sounding like junk, to sounding great, for a cheap drum.
I bought it for my church and the drum sounds great... I love The quality and the sound... Buy it without doubts
Just assembly for a try, only few rolls with music, it's had some hole on head, that's mean bad quality. buyer beware for this kind of.
We've been using Remo heads for years on our kits for our band that plays everything from Classic rock to Speed Metal.Great quality, very durable.You can buy Remo heads with your eyes closed.
all joking aside, these heads really are great. tune em right and you'll get a nice, warm tone from them that's unmatched with other brands
