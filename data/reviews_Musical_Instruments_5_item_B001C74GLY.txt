If you own an American Strat or Tele, this is a must have for the neck of your prize.  I love this.  It proudly states the guitar's origin of Corona. California with the Classic Fender name scribed.  Wonderful.  I have these on all three of my Fenders.  Again, these should really come standard on all American Strats.
Used this to dress up the Saga tele kit I bought on Amazon. It fit perfect and gives the Fender name to a Saga kit guitar. Don't think I'll fool anyone but what the heck.
It fits perfect on my MIM Stratocaster, enhancing the visuals of the back. The "Corona, California" on the back ads a nice touch when you compare it to the other Fender "F" neck plate.
I was going to get the plate with the big "F" on it, but I read complaints that it was very thin, so I kept looking. I took a chance and got this one, and it was a good call. This one is very thick and solid, like it's supposed to be.Great product, great price.
I ordered this after I saw one on a squier bass at a local shop. The plate looks great on my MIM fender Telecaster and it is thicker and nicer than the Fender 'F' plate I see on other guitars. I used the screws and it was an easy install. Other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate. The plate has five screw holes, but doesn't look bad using 4.This is just a visual mod for me mainly to get rid of the crappy cheap plate which is used on my MIM Telecaster.
