Got them today and put them on a Wasburn X series.  Nice sound. I would recommend these to anyone. An inexpensive but nice set.
Sounds and feels nice. I have an entry level guitar, a Peavey Rockmaster. It came with entry level strings. These strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument.Be advised, the low E string is thick. When I try to depress the 12th fret, I can't get it to register as a hit with Rocksmith 2014 unless I press HARD with my middle or index finger. Well, sometimes the pinky is needed to do that. Plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game.
I have used the EXL115W set for years.  Nice to have the whole set again.  Sometimes have to buy the EXL115 without the wound third, and then have to find the wound third in a single string.  Not fun.  I like the sound of the wound third.  I play a thin hollow-body electric and love how the strings sound and are easy on the fingers.  No more thick calouses on the fingers.  Playing weekinds and practicing, they last a long time with the same sound quality.
They have a nice thick sound, bright enough to be clear, good mids, nice bass notes, clear trebles. I like em.
I got these about five months ago and they still have not broken on me. That is a record. The tones are warm and welcoming, not as sharp as with other strings. It is the sound that I like though.
D'addario has been at the forefront of quality and long lasting strings for as long as I can remember.  This guage is perfect for all my arch top guitars.
