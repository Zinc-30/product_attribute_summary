The perfect wall mount for a ukulele. My daughter loves it. Instrument looks great on her wall, and it is easier than taking out of a case to practice. Installs in 5 minutes with included drywall anchors and screws (or mount to wall studs).
I don't know why others rated it as a 4 star.  It is exactly what it says it is and works fine.
I'm a guitar player who owns several electric and acoustic guitars.  I learned a long time ago that guitar-like instruments ought to  be hung by the neck, as one finds them in a music store, to minimize neck warpage, and all my instruments are hung.  This is probably not so important for something as lightweight as a ukulele, but I also thought the instrument would double as wall art.So when my wife unexpectedly brought me back a nice electric-acoustic uke from Hawaii, I immediately went shopping for a wall hanger.  There are more expensive ones out there, but this wooden String Swing turned out to be perfect.  Easy to install, holds the uke perfectly, and the whole thing looks great on the wall.  Call me a satisfied customer.JM Tepper
While this hanger is not unattractive, and is well built I could and will modify it to better suit my needs.  The design of the hanger causes the neck of the &#34;uke&#34; to stand off of the wall 2+ inches at the head and 3-1/2 inches at the hanger itself and 3 inches at the base of the body.  This is not an easy fix but it is doable.
Just like the ones in the store.  We mounted our two ukes on these.  Put our hangers in studs, but they come with those plastic gizmos for drywall.  Heavy duty and nice looking.  Great price.  You just can't beat the speed and convenience of Amazon.
