Now I can create charts no the fly quickly and have perfectly straight lines.  5 frets allows enough room for more complicated chords or even scales.  A must have for guitar teachers IMHO.
This is the large? I can't see how anything any smaller could be of any use at all. The lines for the strings and frets are very close together.
See my previous evaluation on a similar product.  It is all a matter of how large you want to chord chart to be.
I'm an amateur musician and songwriter and this has been very helpful for songwriting ideas.  I haven't studied music formally, so I can't recall what a C#7 looks like versus a F#7 so when I discover a chord shape it's easier for me to diagram it than to look it up on the web.  This helps.
No moving parts. No high tech components. The ultimate in low tech. It's a rubber stamp and it works for the intended purpose. I find this size useful but I guess it depends on the individual's needs. Enough said.
I BOUGHT BOTH THIS STAMP FOR GUITAR AND ALSO ONE FROM THE SAME COMPANY FOR MANDOLIN, UKULELE, BANJO.  I'M PLEASED WITH BOTH STAMPS. LARGE ENOUGH TO SEE, USEFUL TO STAMP CHORDS ON MY OWN MUSIC SHEETS AND OTHER MUSIC THAT DOS NOT HAVE GUITAR CHORDS SHOWN.
