I use these on my acoustic Washburn, and they stay bright for weeks. I have been playing guitar for 30 years, and these are the best.
Great EXTRA Light POLYWEB strings for guitar.  Really impressed with the PolyWeb!  These are easy on my fingers and the polyweb don't sqeek.
My son plays electric and acoustic guitar. He uses Elixir for both and swears by them. He has had other brands, but they just don't stand up to elixir.
What you gain in string life with these strings you loose in tone. I'm not saying the tone is bad, but it's not as good as quality strings with no coat. That having been said, I'm pleased with them as a string for guitar practice. They last for months without a change in tone. I don;t play much in public venues, so it is not a problem for me to change strings when I do.
These strings actually save you money because you don't have to change em much. I keep em on a year or so and I play alot, out door indoor. constant abuse. they never rust. When they break I change em.now..I'm not a player who likes new strings to begin with so I like not having to change em..they really hold up. There are better sounding strings yes. But if your plugin in anyway, you can tweak the tone.The tone isn't bad, just not as good as a martin uncoated string.but if you like longevity and less squeak. these are great.
