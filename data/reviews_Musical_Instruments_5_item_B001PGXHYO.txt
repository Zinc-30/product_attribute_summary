Guitar picks. What can I say? I bought these along with my first guitar, so its not like I have a preference. But they come in a pack of 10 so there are plenty of spares when you lose them, and you will. Definitely good enough to start with until you gain enough experience to know the difference between all the many kinds of picks.
I once bought a guitar case that came with a variety pack (from light to heavy) of Planet Waves picks. Since then, I've used nothing else.I've found that the light picks, (.50mm) are perfect for me. These obviously don't last as long as thicker picks, (but still last a very long time), and they suit my playing style and the type of music I play better. The picks are comfortable to hold and are attractively designed in a faux mother-of-pearl style. I'll definitely continue to buy this brand in the future.
Trying out a few new types of picks and different weights. I found this pick very responsive, flying through the scales on my Les Paul. The pick's weight was perfect. It's durable and easy-gripping.
It is all preference. I bought a couple cactus picks and I like the fact they stick to my fingers better. These are slick and seem harder to keep track of.
What do you say about a little chip of celluloid? Well, almost everyone I know who plays has a preference in guitar picks. These do it for me. I like the look and, more important, I like the feel in my fingers and on the strings. They also seem to make a good, clean sound. I use an Ibanez electric and a Gibson acoustic as my favorites out of seven guitars. Maybe, it's all in my head but, these feel good to me using any of my guitars.
