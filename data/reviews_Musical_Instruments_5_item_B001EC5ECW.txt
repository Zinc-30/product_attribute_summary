Works great with my Fender Super Champ X2 amplifier. However, it does not come with a cable. I would highly recommend.
By recommendation, from the Acoustic tech people, I purchased this for my Acoustic 300B.  Unfortunately it was the Wong switch. BUT&#62;&#62;&#62;It has true FENDER quality.  Well built. Heavy duty construction. The switches are rock solid. This switch can withstand some heavy, quick switch, action.. Rubber, no skid, bottom is a plus. I KEPT the switch because of the quality. I know It will come in handy sooner or later.  .
I bought this to go with my Super Champ X2 combo.  It works.  It also came with a cord.I was not happy the Super Champ X2 didn't come with it.  Both my Hot Rod Deluxe and Blues DeVille came with foot switches.  And you really need the foot switch to use the X2's various voicings and effects. Now the X2 is my main amp.
You need this to get the most out of your Super-Champ XD amp. The only way that i can see an improvement is to make the end pcs out of aluminum instead of plastic. No telling how long the switches will last? Fender tends to make good products. Price isnt too bad but this item should come with the amp IMO.
I really like the foot-switch. Seems well made for the price and works as advertised. I just needed something to change channels on my Fender Super Champ XD.
Works great with my Fender Super Camp X2. Easy connection, easy activation of switches, immediate response. Small, light and compact. Great product.
