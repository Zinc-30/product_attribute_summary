it works, got it on time, good price
Ordered this and two cables! This came and it is so sleek and pretty and the xlr cables fit in it well but the button to turn on the phantom power is a little loose but other than that it is a wonderful little unit! I recommend!
Plugged it in and it powered my Rode NT2 condenser mic.  I was delighted.
Delivery was Amazon fast, installation took all of 2 minutes and we were making music.  It has worked perfectly from the start and as continued without a flaw for the last 6 months, and we expect it to continue for years.  For the price you can't go wrong.  Mic sound is pristine, no noise, we use it for vocal recording in studio, run it off an M-Audio Mixer Keyboard which lacked Phantom power.  Top Recommendation.
Phantom power supplies aren't very sexy items, but they're extremely important if you want to use condensor microphones. This Nady box is dead quiet and works like a charm. Totally no-frills, rock solid metal construction and you can't hear it at all.
It supplies my microphones every time I run out. I'm glad I got this thing. I rate it five out of five stars.
Does what it says with no whining whatsoever, really quiet producing absolutely no audible hum. Very small footprint, too! Would I recommend it? Yes. I would.
