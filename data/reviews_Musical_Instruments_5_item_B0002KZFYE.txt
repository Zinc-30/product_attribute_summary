I needed a Jack Plate for my custom Stratocaster build and ordered this one.  It was far better than I expected.  It is very heavy duty, great chrome plating.  Not at all what I expected for the money.  A definite quality part worthy of this project that will be with me for life.  Nothing but the best going on this guitar, including this plate.
Was upgrading the chrome on an MIM. Perfect fit.  Used Switchcraft jack.  Includes screws and 1 washer(for the jack).  Looks great.
Spipped and received on time,It fits, it works, it is heavier guage than most replacements. happy with it - like it.
Fender quality is just a step above the competition and worth the extra money over cheaper generic products.  Worked perfectly for my latest guitar project.
Not much to screw up.  Good quality parts, on an essential product.  Brain-dead simple install. And no surprises; works like a champ!
Wow, I'm shocked. A Fender aftermarket product that didn't come with some sort of defect or problem. Amazing. Whomever does QC for this part should take over the the complete aftermarket parts division and replace the guys that do QC for the other parts I've purchased.
Not a lot of moving parts on this piece. LOL Its a simple piece to attach to your strat body.
