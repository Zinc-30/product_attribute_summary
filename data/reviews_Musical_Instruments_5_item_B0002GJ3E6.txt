This is the best one out there BAR NONE  !  Really, this is a keeper.  Wish it came in different neon colors, as it would be really easy to find when you have broken a string on stage.  That would make this one the BEST.
This unit has a wider handle than most of the inexpensive string winders.  I've restrung a dozen guitars in the past week, including two 12-strings, and it is holding up well.
Very happy with my new Peg Winder, feels very ergonomic, works well and is nice to use, Thanks for the prompt service and good price .... Cheers !!
I have a few Planet Waves products and I can safely recommend them.  This is no different, it works, I have no issues with the product, if you are looking for a peg winder,  or any accessory, I'd recommend you look at Planet Waves among your research in brands.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.
It works for what it is, it just feels a little light when you wind after getting the tension up.  Not a bad product, just don't know how long it will last.
