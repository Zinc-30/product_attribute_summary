I simply love the cradle from Jim Dunlop (although a little pricey).  First, the material that the neck rests in is very soft.  Overall it is bigger than appears and it gives me warm fuzzies to know my guitar won't fall off of that skimpy little 3 legged arrangement sold elsewhere on this Planet.  I did find it to be a little short to support my Ovation Acoustic Bass, but a small length of 2 x 4 fixed that.  Second, it is nice that it just rotates over to support the front of the fretboard while guitar is on its face which I need to get into the back guts side of my Ovation.
Very good and very useful device. Very solidly built and it does what it was designed to do, very very well.
Definitely holds the guitar well . a little pricey but probably worth it. I'm a fan of Dunlop in general but think they got it right with this one.
The Dunlop neck cradle is well designed and firmly supports the neck of any guitar. It is self adjusting and makes restringing a breeze!  Buy one, and I am sure you will like it as well as I.
This is what I have needed for many years. Really well made, very sturdy and will last forever, and it is useful for all the Guitar work I need to do. I think it is reasonably priced as well. Thanks for a great product and good prompt service Cheers !!!
I was impressed by the sturdiness and size of this neck cradle. Combined with the OP/TECH work mat that I purchased I can now turn almost any table or bench into a handy guitar workstation. In my experience Jim Dunlop always makes good products and this one continues that tradition.
