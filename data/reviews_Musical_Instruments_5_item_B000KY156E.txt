Let me begin with a Public Service Announcement: If you want to buy other EZDrummer expansion packs, YOU NEED TO BUY THIS PRODUCT FIRST!***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Toontrack is scheduling the public release of EZ Drummer 2.0 in May 2014. If you buy EZ Drummer 1.0 from now until then, you will ALSO get the download for 2.0. Bear in mind, EZD2 is a completely new/different program from EZD1, and so I would jump on this opportunity considering you get the stock EZD1 Pop/Rock Kit (which has some very kit pieces) in addition to the EZD2 default kit (which is more reminiscent of the ROCK! expansion kit from what I've seen). EZ Drummer 2.0 also gives you the ability to mix/mash kit pieces from all expansions, and so to me this makes EZ Drummer a MUST BUY based on the sheer customization available. ***RESUME NORMAL PROGRAMMING***If you are an amateur musician and you want a quality virtual drum kit, EZDrummer is probably the best bang for the buck you'll find. It's very easy to use, very easy to program, and overall a well made product. You might be tempted to compare EZDrummer to its bigger and better brother: Superior Drummer 2.0, made by the same company. Superior Drummer is superior to EZDrummer, but is a little more tedious and more suitable for musicians who want an exact close-to-life sounding virtual instrument.There are ways to improve the off-the-shelf sound quality of EZDrummer immediately. YouTube has plenty of video tutorials on this, but what you want to do is open up your Digital Audio Workstation (Pro Tools, Cubase, etc), and set EZDrummer for multi-track output. From there you'll be able to tweak the different outputs EZDrummer has as if you were in a studio and had 7 mics at your disposal. Most high-end professional studios use about 10 mics to capture everything on a drum kit, and so 7 virtual mics is nothing to scoff at: Kick Drum, Snare Top and Bottom, Toms, Cymbals, Overhead, and Room. Once you have each of those outputs running, you can perform individual EQs to change the tone dramatically. Adding a touch of distortion/gain and room reverb will make the stock kit sound REALLY close-to-life. In reality, once you have additional instruments layered and everything mixed and balanced, it only takes a trained ear to tell that it's a virtual kit.As far as the expansions go, if you are looking to record a particular style of music, then I highly recommend buying the EZX kit that goes with that genre. The stock Rock kit is VERY GOOD (after performing the mods above)... but only for Rock. As for me personally, I did my best to EQ and tweak the crap out of it to get a nice metal tone, but in the end, I found the Rock kit lacking, especially since it's a "tight" kit (3 toms, 3 cymbals, 1 hi-hat, 1 snare, 1 kick).
I write and record my own music.  I stink at writing drums.  I don't play drums, I don't really have room for a drumset, and I really don't want to spend the money on a drumset to see if I can figure it out.  This is a great program for non-drumming, one man bands like me.  MIDI drums and the drum sounds from my Yamaha keyboard just wasn't cutting it.  It works with Ableton Live 9 with no problems.  Tons of different grooves.  It sounds like a real drummer on a real drumset.  Very easy to use.
The software itself (sound/interface): 4.5 starsThe installation and activation: 2 starsPROS:1) The drums included in EZ Drummer are the most realistic "computer drums" I have ever heard. I'm using them on my latest song and have gotten nothing but compliments on how they sound.2) All sounds are MIDI, which means you can manipulate how you see fit. I use EZ Drummer with MixCraft and have modified pretty much every beat I have used so far with the built-in MIDI editing capabilities.3) The interface is clean an easy to use. You just drag a beat from the EZ Drummer window into your DAW.CONS:When I was reading reviews I just thought the people complaining about the install/activation were being wusses. I mean seriously, how hard can it be? Well, they were right, it sucks. It took me two hours to get it all working.My advice: Don't even install the app from the included disc. Instead, just go create yourself an account at toontrack.com and download the most up-to-date version and ALL the patches for the modules that come with it.My experience:1) Try to install from disc. Fails with a 1308.2) Google'd the problem. Found out I needed to get a toontrack.com account and download the installer from there.3) Downloaded the ~650 MB ZIPPED installer. Then, I had to unzip the 18,000 files, which took about 20 minutes on my PC.4) I was finally able to install it and then had to download three other updates to the modules within the install.5) Then I had to jump through one final hoop to active it (take this key copy it here, then copy this here, stand on your head, etc..).Great software, horrible install.~Slick
A breeze to install on my mac mini, simple to use with Garageband. The bad reviews here are bizarre, written by inept people who either can't handle the install or have a buggy PC or OS. I was up and running 5 minutes after I tore off the shrink wrap from the packaging.There's plenty of specs/details/videos on the interwebs about this software, go do some research, see if you like it. It's way better than the drum kits that come with Garageband and there's plenty of kits to expand with. I got the Vintage Rock kit and I love it - almost as much as I love pizza, which I will marry some day. I like a cheese pizza. Some call it "plain" but with the right blend of sauce, cheese and crust, there's nothing plain about it - it's somewhat complex, much like myself. We are a perfect match, pizza and me. We go together like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom. I'm not exclusively a thin crust guy, sometimes I dig something a bit thick or an all out deep dish.The only weak point in this pizza I mean software is that you can't do a cymbal swell. Apparently, it's the same with all these virtual kits, regardless of brand, but it would be nice if someone (toontrack) would address it by including a "side stick" attack on the crashes. If you try to do a cymbal swell, you hear the initial stick-on-cymbal "ting" with each attack, so it's kind of a "ting-ting-ting-ting" sound instead of "bwooooosssshhhhh." I'm sure I can find a bwoosh loop without a ting-ting. Bwoosh loop - no ting-ting. Do I get a fortune cookie with that?Pizza time!Ohhh, myyyy loooove... my darlin'... I hun-ger for.... your crust....
I could go on and on for days, but the best things about EZD are the endless EZX packs you can add in and the fact that all drum grooves have a mic on each drum as well as room and overhead mics which give you that live, organic sound that you can never get with loops.You can edit the grooves and fills via MIDI if you need too, add in cymbals, etc. It's really, really an amazing program. Best money I ever spent!
