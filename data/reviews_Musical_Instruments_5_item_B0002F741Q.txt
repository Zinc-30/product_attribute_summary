I like to hit things. I use drums so nobody else gets hurt. I need the sticks to most effectively channel my aggression into the drums and not, say, local wildlife. These have the sweetest tone for battery-based abuse. Thanks Vic! Also, flammable!
My 8th graders are literally beating the crap out of these sticks. They are good and reasonably priced.  The principal is mad at me because I told them that a real drummer plays constantly, so the walls in the halls, cafeteria tables, and classroom desks are getting pounded constantly.
They are some of the best drum sticks i've played. They lasted me about two weeks before I had to move on to another before.
sad right?i do play instruments (guitar & piano) some drums but it's not why i bought these drum sticks.My old roommmate stole my drum sticks so this was the next cheapest thingthey play well on the pads.i'm sure they'd have nice action off a snare drum and high hat in real life...
I have always liked these sticks. They are solid, look good and feel good. You will always get quality from vic firth. Only downer is they seem to break faster then some sticks such as Vaders.
These are great for all around playing. I've never received a bad stick from Amazon. These are reasonably priced and so much more convenient than going to Guitar Center and having to deal with the idiot in the drum room.I have a wide variety of Vic sticks that I bought here on Amazon. Another favorite is the 2BN, it's a log with a nylon tip, great for heavy metal thrashing, very articulate.Good music to all
These sticks are solid hickory, which is insanely durable, and sounds great for classic rock, and punk rock drums. These sticks are weight, and sound matched, so each pair will sound and feel almost identical.
Nice feeling to them, they get the job done and that about sums it all up, can't expect to much more from them.
