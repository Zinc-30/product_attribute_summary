This came in the mail today in a rather large box. The blue LED light is fine, you can put about 5 medium picks in the Pick holder. More than enough to keep me and a friend in picks for a few songs. It is not bad but I don't think I would purchase another one.
This unique gift put a big smile on the male teen musician in our home and that made me smile.
Great use to hold a guitar pick and to use to find your keys to open the door with.My son likes it and uses it often
I had intended to carry this, with my keys, attached to my chain wallet. But the wallet hasn't arrived yet so be warned it is a little bit of a pocket space eater. But I suspected it would be before I ordered it so I don't count that against it. Holds 3 medium picks with grip exceptionally tight...almost annoyingly hard to get one out. Will be sure to update if wear & tear has any effect on the grip on the picks. But so far, so great and would consider purchasing this for my musically inclined friends.
I clip this pick holder to my music stand and it's always handy, and very easy to use.  I use thin picks and was able to fit four of them into this holder.
