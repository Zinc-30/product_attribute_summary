Very sturdy stand made to last a lifetime.  Easy enough to adjust and can hold a lot of weight.  Cannot go wrong with this one.
This is a great stand.  In the past I have been plagued with light flimsy stands so decided to go for something that appeared solid and well made.  This one serves the bill.  I am impressed with the construction and so far it has been very stable.  It is not as handy to haul around as some of the more flimsy ones but the proof is what it does when it is in use.  I use it regularly for events and so far am very pleased.
The music stand is quite sturdy and well made in my humble opinion. I needed a music stand that could support a note book of music I have assembled over the years. This was great. I added a clip on LED light as well. PERFECT :-)
Strong folds nice to bring it with you on a job. The price was right. May buy another for a spare.
I needed a good solid stand for my music while seated playing guitar.  solid- yes, adjusts to right height - YesIt is perfect! WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY.
I was looking for something more solid than the usual fold up stand and this is it.  I can put a heavy notebook full of music on it and a lamp and a tray and more stuff and it is rock solid.  Very happy.
No complaints whatsoever.Product is a solid build and prices right.Knobs work well and the stand doesn't slip.Legs hold up pretty well also.
This was so perfect that we bought 2 more of them for our music at home!
nice wide lip, sturdy, appears to be well made and durable, nice finish on it, hopefully will last a long time
Assembled the stand in seconds. It is very stable and solidly constructed. Should last a life-time. Very, very good value.
