Not much to say about a basic bag.  It fits a dreadnaught acoustic 6 string guitar, has good padding, and has a large front pouch for music and small (fairly flat) items like a tuner, winder or spare strings.  Has a carry handle/strap, but no shoulder straps on the back as some others have.  Seems well made.
Just an all around nice case, good construction, good zipper and padded enough without causing it to become hard to maneuver.  This isn't one of those semi walled cases, this is just a normal gig bag.  Works for me, in fact I bought another for my classical.
Nicely made and well-padded guitar soft-case purchased to protect a Jasmine S34C NEX Acoustic Guitar.  The guitar fit inside the case perfectly, and a zippered pocket on the case allows for storage of picks, stings and other flat items.  Very nice product.
This product is exactly what they say it is.Good material,decent padding,nice front pocket,zippers function without issue.My acoustic cutaway fits nice and snug.I wanted a case mainly to protect my guitar at home,and this works great.Definately worth $25.
I've been using this for my 'beater' guitar, and it has done just fine in the back of my car, etc. It isn't bulletproof, but you'd have to pay a lot more for airline level protection anyway. Medium padding and a decent sized zipper pocket, more than I expected for the price.
