Great little piece of leather. Does what I want it to do and does not hurt my guitar. Thank you
I like using these strap ties far more than I do tying a strap to the neck.  They are a great idea.  I found the button on the strap somewhat difficult to install the strap, but eventually got it on.  I have two of these, and I use them.  I'd definitely recommend them to anyone who doesn't like tying on their guitar straps.
If you do not want to have a hole drilled in your new Martin guitar, this is a must have product. I didn't want to have a hole drilled in a new Martin guitar, so this worked fine wit the Martin leather straps. Actually I bought two of them..... It is a 5-star product.
this is a great item.and works as reported.It seemed to be in my fretting hands way a little,but its ok
I received this yesterday in my order.  It fits on my guitar fine, but I can't seem to get my guitar strap affixed to the head stock strap.  The button is so rounded and smooth, that my guitar strap just won't go over the top of the button.  Not sure what to do now.
This is an attractive leather head stock strap.  The leather is very soft and flexible. I would love to have an entire guitar strap made from the same leather.
