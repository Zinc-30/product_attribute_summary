I needed a new microphone cable due to my son destroying the last one so this decided to invest more in a higher quality cable. This GLS Mic cable is working well. The build quality appears good and should be much harder for my son to break.
GLS continues to supply top quality cables at a reasonable price. I have been happy with all my purchases from GLS to date and will continue to use them whenever the need arises.
I've been using GLS cable for years now and I never had a problem with it. They're good quality cable and will go a long way if you will take care of it.
I've only need to use this a couple of times and it worked well.  The cover is supple and easy to coil.
i have only used it a couple of times but the cable works.  it is what i expected it to be.
