The Pyle-Pro PMKS8 mic stand is good for someone looking to buy on a budget. It's fairly solid, heavy enough to hold itself down, and is flexible enough to position the mic how you need it.There are a few issues, however. The metal neck is difficult to tighten onto its base without causing the microphone to be crooked. This means you have to choose between having a straight forward mic and having a mic which doesn't swivel around on its base. The mic holder has the same issue.I would not use this mic stand for an event where it's plainly visible to an audience. It is simply too difficult to position it to look good on camera.I would use this mic stand for personal voice recording an communication. It's great for a desk or a small recording studio.
Perfect for my obscure use.I discarded the mic clip (or more so, added it to my collection,) and attached a RAM mount to the gooseneck. Now I have a universal articulating mount on a flexible post. What to do with it? I use this contraption to watch movies on my ipod touch on long flights. No more holding a little phone-sized thing up to my face for hours on end. This stand and the mount get the small screen right up to my line of vision.
What can you say about something that you need but is really insignificant in the scheme of things.  I needed it and it works simple as that
It's always been a problem trying to keep the Desk microphone in one place. Promblem resolved, by purchasing this stand my heavy Shure57 stays in one place. The only thing is I wish the flex was a little longer, about three inches would be great. But otherwise a wise and good purchase.
This is what it shows, a simple small mic stand that dont fall over. Good for table top, cajon hole by floor or recording.Its well made and works well.
