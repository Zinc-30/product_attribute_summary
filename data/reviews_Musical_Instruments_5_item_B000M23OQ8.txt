I use this ALL the time.  It's pretty basic but really good for a beginner.  (Not all chords are in here but the &#34;core&#34; chords are).  Worth the price-
This Guitar Tuner is such a great and useful tool. It teaches chords and got me to play my guitar better in less than one day.Thanks, Austin Garcia
I picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store.  Who doesn't need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag, right?  The price was less than ten bucks, but unfortunately it doesn't work very well.  The microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate.  It gets you in the ballpark, but just barely.  Strike a note once, and it's sharp.  Play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune.  I think the Korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better.
Very versatile tuner. It automatically tunes to the string so you just pick and tune away! It also shows you chords in case you have forgotten them. There are other things you can do on this tuner and for the price it is a great buy!
loved this thing, I have since lost it, as happens with little doo-hickeys like this, lol. worked good. pretty precise, meaning you will fight with it to where it is happy. sometimes it felt a little off, but robots know best, right?
I am suing this item on a regular basis to tune my guitar, and it seems to work fine, no complains
Had a guitar for years,, always tune it but never time to practice, it tells you what note is actually being played when your string is out of tune so you can zero in on the correct one better..
Very compact size and easy to use.Good feature for the price.Shipping is fast.very happy for this product.Best recommended.
It works great, not much I can say beyond that.
