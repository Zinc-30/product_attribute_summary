The picks we received were "Legacy" and not "Alice" brand. While not as pictured, these are good enough for us as we (my daughert, son, and me) learn to play guitars. The mix of different thicknesses was fairly even, so we were able to select the one that felt "right" for each of us.The pearliod looks good and overall am happy with these picks.CFH
Wow, is what my teenage son said when he opened this on Christmas morning.  He loved the variety & number of picks!
This was a terrific deal.My son loses picks all over the house and plays electric and acoustic, so I decided to get this mixed batch and he says they are great.
I've been using these picks for eight months and they last forever. I lose them before they wear out. I'll be buying and recommending these for a long time.
These picks come in a large range of sizes, but most of them are way too thick to play any guitar with.There is a really funny smell to these when you first use them that gets on your fingers, but it goes away after a bit.They seem to be decent quality. The thin picks have not torn on me yet and the medium gauge picks dont wear down too quickly.These are ok to have around the house to play with but I would not recommend them for live performance.
This was a great purchase.  A bagful of pretty picks to help my son with his new guitar.  Good thing there were so many in the bag because he seems to keep losing them.  Great price and purchase.
