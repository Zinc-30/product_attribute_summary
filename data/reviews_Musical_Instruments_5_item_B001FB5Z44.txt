I bought this for my Takamine EGSF15SC acoustic/electric guitar and it fits snugly and does the job very well.I am very happy with the low price I got, and am very pleased with the overall quality of this case.It has exceeded my expectations.
It works for what I need! It arrived earlier than I expected! Really nice! My guitar is safe now with this hard case!
The case is very nice and sturdy. It has lasted over a year and will last for more years to come. The inside is very nice and soft with a big pocket to put things in it like picks, tuners, capos. It also has a lock on the case in case one might need it. This is a very good price for a case of this good of quality and I highly recommend it.
great case, didn't really notice a smell that everyone was complaining about. holds my seagal s6 very well. great guitar by the way for the price. but anyways the case has some compartments inside that can fit like tuners and accessories which comes in handy. the padding is done very well
This is a great case that came TWO WEEKS earlier than the arrival date. In came in good packaging and I found no flaws when inspecting it. My Jasmine fits snugly inside of it, no bumping whenever I carry the case. The only problem I have is it smells terrible! But that's fine; I just left it open on the deck for two days and the smell is not noticeable. Other than that, this was a great investment!
I ordered this hard case for my Fender T bucket. It fits exactly like an original fender hard case. Looks like made of good materials. Very well built. With interior pocket to put your accesories like capo, string winder, etc. I Love it. For its PRIce and Quality,I giving it a 5 star :O)..
