These picks are really nice if your tastes run in the jazz pick direction. It's easy to play fast tricky lines with the smaller hard picks. give them a shot
great picks,, they are shorter for speed and maneuvering sweeps better not to stumble in strings when sweep,, so for me it works fine i do use Th turtle purple big ext HH as well but i like to try this for experiment to see how it helps spleen on sweeps etc,, nice picks well made
Good picks but not a replacement for jazz 3 that I still prefer over this one, nice backup in case you run out.
I'm really happy with the Black Ice Heavy picks (1.10 mm), which I bought after being badly disappointed with my last order of Dunlop Jazz IIIs.I would call the Black Ice picks medium sized.  They are roughly the same size and shape as Fender 551 picks, but a little bigger than the Jazz IIIs.  They are stiffer than the 551s and perhaps a touch less stiff than the IIIs (and thinner than the IIIs too).One thing that may account for the nice way the Black Ice perform is that the edges are beveled and smoothly finished in a way which differs from the 551s (which I still like) and from the Jazz IIIs.In terms of playability, they are about the same to me as any other pick of this shape and stiffness.But the most important thing to me is the hardest thing to communicate to you:  The tone.  I love the tone I get with these picks, and the best I can do for you is to say that I was looking for a pick that would generate a solid, mellow jazz tone with an archtop - a tone that reminds me of say, Barney Kessel (but without Barney's chops of coursse).  This is what the Black Ice delivers.
I do like this pick, I bought a few different types to have a variety to &#34;Pick&#34; from.  A suggestion from my teacher.  Good suggestion, depending on what kind of guitar I'm playing on, it changes the tone.  I like this one.
