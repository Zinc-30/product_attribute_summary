Good quality one. I like the big size type. Would like to have a thinner one. So far so good.
These are a little larger than a traditionally sized, what you normally see used picks.  Thus, just a heads-up.  Having said that, they are top quality and are excellent picks.  I use all types and all brands and Fender's are always predictably great quality.
This shape give the strumming hand a better grip on the pick. I sand a bit from one of the points to give it a shape more like the classic heart-shaped Fender pick. The stock rounded point dulls the attack on the string. Good for strumming rhythm, not so hot for lead.
So glad I found these,  three sides,  much easier for me to hold,  thin is in!  As a beginner these make much more comfortable.
Maybe a little bigger than I'm comfortable with, but my guy friends with the huge hands love these things. They keep disappearing.
