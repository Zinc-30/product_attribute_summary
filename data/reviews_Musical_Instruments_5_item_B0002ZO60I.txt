These things grab the mic and won't let go. They are worth the extra cost. Buy them if you hate worrying about your mics slipping.
Sturdy mic clip on a budget. Mic fits snugly into the clip, allowing the rage to commence. Will purchase more as needed.
It does what it is suppose to, cut vibration and well I might add. Much better than a standard clip on a mic. This one is not going to break if you take the mic on and off, since it's rubber. If it does break, has a lifetime warranty. Had a Shure SM58 on a table, on a stand in this clip, pounded on the table, only picked up the tap sound my hand has making, and no sub harmonics vibrating though the table. Moved the mic off axis, pounded again, absolutely no noise. Can't ask for more than that.
I've had many Mic Holders, and this one is by far the very best.  It does it all and is tougher than nails.  Sincerely, Doc
I was upset when I bought the mic stand and didn't know the clip didn't come with it.So I had to order a clip later.Nevertheless, It has good design to dampen the shocks.It is also rubber in construction so it won't crack like the other low quality clips.It is a bit big for the cabled mics (so you have to insert it deeper to hold it snag), but for wireless mics, it is good.I would recommend it.
It is a nice clip, works for my mics.I don't like the soft opening. It makes you not easy to put back the mics.
I purchased this for use with a Sennheiser E825-S microphone and the bestselling On Stage boom microphone stand. The mount has exceeded my expectations. The fit for the stand is perfect, with the mount pivoted so that the mike can be adjusted up or down. The part actually holding the mike is flexible and rubbery, making it very easy to slide the mike and its cord in and out. A screw tightens te pivot if this needs to be fixed more firmly in place. All in all, a very worthwhile and economical purchase.
