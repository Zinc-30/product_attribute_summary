I bought these to put on my really old Martin acoustic. The guitar still sounds amazing, and these strings certainly fit my budget, and provide a great sound.
These are one of the best strings I've used. I'm a blues guitarist so they take a beating well. Very much worth the cost and I thank Amazon for having them!
These are good strings, for a good price.  I have purchased these strings several times and they sound good and last a long time.
These strings retain a good feeling for a long time, well past the point of them needing changed because they've lost brightness.
But these seemed to work well on the guitar I was re-stringing. My son thought they were great and he knows quite a bit more.Recommend.
I bought these a while ago but just got around to using them last week. I don't ever remember the non wound strings being bronze but these are. To me it looks weird but they sound so much better than my ancient strings that were on there.
Brand name, good string, good tone, seem to last awhile but I change strings often so never really know how long a set will last.
I used to use Elixir Nano string, and a good as they sound, they do not last. These do. great sounding strings.
I've used these strings on all my acoustics and even gave some to a band mate.  They seem to keep their tone for a long time and don't change the instrument tone like some strings I've tried.  Like a lot of folks, I'm not that picky about my strings, but for those who are, this is a good light string that will sound great on your acoustic.
These strings are great sounding, and great looking on the fretboard, because they are bronze. One issue I had, was the 5th and 6th strings were too big to route more than once through the tuning head, but it still wound up very nicely. I would actually say that you might want to get the Extra Light gauge, but it's probably just my tuning machines, they kind of suck.
