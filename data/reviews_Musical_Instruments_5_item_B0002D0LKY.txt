Good length but very slippery.  I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around.  I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now.  For the price, why not?  Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric.  As far as the base product, it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear.
I just put this on my Dot Hollowbody.  It's a big, heavy guitar and this strap looks good and does the job.  I like how it looks and feels and would buy another one just like it.  The price was great, had the Gibson name on it and was a great value.  5 stars.
Got this for my electric guitar.  I am able to adjust it to the length I play with.  Very sturdy guitar strap.
It just randomly pops off my bass, it's so slick that when you let go it the neck just goes straight down. I hate it.
i love the design, and the strap holds up very well. i would reccomend to anyone who likes gibson or the lightning bolt symbol.
I hope there had been a closer picture of the product.I was a little surprised when I got it because it doesn't look as great as I imagined.The white lightning is stamped on the black strap, the same goes for the GIBSON name on the end of it.Maybe it will get better looking in the long run.
Had this strap for 20 years now and still going on strong. Just a simple well made product that does the job. Perfect for those who use the instrument very high on the chest. Looks classic too!
