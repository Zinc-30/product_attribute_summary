I am collecting these unique guitar picks and putting them into pick display cases.  This is a great pick!  I am using the other 5 and they play very well!
Really cool looking and are nice picks for the $$.  The eye holes really do make it a better gripping pick than a standard pick.  Great deal from amazon - - thanks!!  I will definitely buy more of these in the future!!
a little small for my hands, but the kids that take lessons from me loved them.  Cute idea.  Would like different holiday designs like this.
These picks are pretty cool, fairly stiff despite their thinness. They are also a bit pointier than regular picks, and the eye holes give it an interesting tactile quality. Nice to try something new, although they are a bit slippery.
I rarely play with one, as I prefer a thin pick and these are more along the lines of medium, but when I do pull one out of my pocket to play, it always gets attention.
