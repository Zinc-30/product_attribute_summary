I have always trusted the Graph Tech TUSQ products and this is no different.  The compensation for this saddle was almost spot on with little adjustment needed.
I replaced a bone non-compensated saddle of my parlor sized guitar with this.This is a convenient product as the thing is already close to final thickness you need, you don't need to change the compensation much if at all,  the material sands easier than bone, polishes well, and the tone is really good.A little careful sanding/polishing and the guitar was ready to play. I like the product.
I had to make some adjustments on the neck of my Martin d-28 and remove the bridge pickup. This left the saddle too low to the neck.  I researched the "Tusq" products and found enough people impressed to give it a try.  I'm pleased to say I find more ring through the body and a better sustain.  I'll do this to my other acoustics as time goes on.
I bought a tusq nut and this tusq saddle for an Aria acoustic which can be a nice sounding guitar. The difference is quite noticeable and good. The guitar is a modest model but it is a player with a "better than a lot more expensive guitars" sound. I had a bone nut that cracked which is why I tried these replacements. In my estimation the sound is clearer, brighter and louder. The price seemed high for a little chunk of "plastic" but the difference in sound leaves me satisfied.
When I purchased this I'd seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar. Guess what? As far as I can tell, there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with. This is NOT worth the money.
