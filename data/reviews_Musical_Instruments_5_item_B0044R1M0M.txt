It wasn't terrible for someone who was a beginner with electric guitars and amp but after a while, it becomes less and less useful.
This may be 10Watts but it can fill a big room with its sound. Not too heavy and very handy for traveling. This can't be used for concert or gigs but for use in private/family use or maybe inside a church. Built is good and the power of the sound is sufficient.
This little dude weighs next to almost nothing. It gets loud enough as you need it in a bedroom (LOUD), don't expect to gig with it, and don't expect Marshall Tube quality, either. It does however, sound amazing!! It's clean, bright and loud. For metal it's got great control of the distortion tone, which sounds pretty good.
A good solid piece of equipment with great tone and control! It came extremely well packed. For the price, this is one great little dynamo!
Good basic first amp.  Great for practicing in the bedroom without bothering everyone in the house!  Compact size makes storage easy.
Rogue G10 10W Guitar Combo Amp Black is good small amp for practicing.Actually, it's loud enoucht for home.Recommend it.
I thought that this may be just a joke but it turns out that it's a nice little portable amp.Of course you can't drive it very hard or the distortion gets to be too much, but if you keepit low it works very nicely and the price makes it very attractive.
I use the amp in my shop when testing out new guitar configurations (Pickups) on the flyand then if it sounds OK go to the big boys in my blues room.The amp will reach its max in short order, but again, for what it is and the price, it ishard to find an equal.
My son purchased this himself to go with his new guitar and he is thrilled with it.  The Amp works really well and he was thrilled with the price of it.  Great purchase.
A nice little amp to rock out with... So it may not be what professionals use or anything like that but it gets the job done which is all I asked.
