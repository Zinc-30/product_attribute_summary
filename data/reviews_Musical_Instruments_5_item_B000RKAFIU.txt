Having 250 feet of xlr - xlr (m-f) cables that can be used any way I want (e.g. 2 ea 125 foot for stereo, 1 250 foot for mono, or 10 ea 25 foot for multichannel work) is very flexible.The packaging on these was also well done with a ziploc type bag and a velcro reusable wrap on each cord (white) to store them when not in use.As all of my sound equip is xlr or speakon connectors, this worked great for a recent outdoor dj job.  I ended up using all 10 of the 25' cords for mics and amplified speakers, plus another 6 of their 3 foot cables for interconnect.  You can never have enough xlr cables or adapters!
These aren't the dirt-cheap - these actually have some nicer connectors - mid-grade level. They aren't the cheap type with a rubber boot that pretends to be a strain-relief - these are screw on plastic bits with a more sturdy housing. Decent cables and aren't too expensive. Will buy again...
GLS Audio 25ft Mic Cable is very High Quality. You will not be disappointed. Low cost, long lasting. I'm very satisfied.
I've used these at every gig I have run sound at for 2 months and so far they have passed the test with flying colors. They allow me to concentrate on other more important things than the reliability of my cables.
I needed a few extra cables this year for a few live sound events. For the price point I was worried about buying "cheap cables". This are a great value for your buck. The only thing I didn't like about these... the cable ties suck! haha... If you need some quality "cheap" cable, these are for you!
