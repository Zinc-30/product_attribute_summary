Just bought this to see if it would inspire any new sounds for me.  WOW I love it.  The capo works great with no buzzing and holds the strings down well.  I am using it with a Seagull Entourage mini jumbo.  It sounds divine.  It makes chords nice and open and it is a blast to play with on the folk sound of the seagull, a nice mellow relaxed open sound.  Inspires my ears to make music.  Buy it.
This capo is great for adding another level to your guitar playing without retuning your instrument!Highly recommended! Just a nice sound it brings to your playing and has a bunch of great new chord combinations to mess around with!
I play in different tunings and just slapping this on a standard tuned guitar makes for a lot of fun.  That's all I can say.  It makes me creative and I have easily thrown together a dozen instrumental fingerstyle tunes using this.  It's just fun.
This partial capo from Kyser has the same design, construction, and ease of use as Kyser's top-ranked and bestselling 6-string cano. It is definitely recommended. If you choose to go down he partial capo path, though, it's best that you either jam with friends who are familiar with partial capos or buy Randall Wolliams' manual on the partial capo, since its use is not intuitively obvious.
this capo helps make aesome music, thankful for it, i like using it for all kinds of palying, like at the beach
