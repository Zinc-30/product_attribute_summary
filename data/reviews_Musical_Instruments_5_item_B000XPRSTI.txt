Looks great, feels great, and works great! The leather is soft and adjusts to the contour of my shoulder and back comfortably and securely. great! I love it!
Width and padding are good for Heavier guitar (currently being used on a Les Paul). Finish, stitching, and adjustments are quality.The only issue I had was needing super human strength to push onto the strap pegs.You might want to unscrew and screw pegs back on with the strap in place...But that means the guitar is very secure, so I am very happy.
Study strap. Great feel, leather matches my instrument well. 2-1/2&#34; width worked well for me compared to the 4&#34; version.
Heavy construction in layered leather.There is no pressure on the shoulder and it is very expensive looking.I will buy another in a second color.
This is hands down the most comfortable strap I own.  I am pretty sure it is really a bass strap but I use it on my electric guitars and it is superbly comfortable.  Not cheap but keep looking to see if there is a sale or a demo model.  Worth the wait.
If you are playing a guitar that costs several hundreds to several thousand dollars, why would anyone buy a cheap guitar strap to hold it up. I have friends who think strap-locks are the best invention of the century but, I believe in buying a quality guitar strap & Levy's produces some of the best on the market. I own several acoustic & electric guitars... for the most part, I have a strap for each one except the pieces too valuable to take to a gig. Every strap is a Levy's...I'll call myself a veteran pro guitarist (I don't believe in using the word "old") who gigs about 12 - 15 days a month. This strap is comfortable to wear & strong enough to hold up my Gibson Les Paul Standard without any worries of dropping it. I've watched friends & band-mates constantly adjusting or reattaching their straps... I offer my advise to buy a quality strap & find most continue to use crap straps. BUY IT... You will love it!
