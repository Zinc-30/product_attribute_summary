I ordered this tuner so I could carry it around with my ukelele in a gig bag.  It's worked fine.  I've used it to tune a ukelele, a bass, and a guitar, and it works fine on all counts.  I have no complaints about it.
This is a good item and has served me well.  However I just upgraded to an Intellitouch PT10 for a bit more money and its a much more convenient and really easy to use.  The Korg runs off of ambient sound and gets interference from background noise while the Intellitouch is a clip on and uses vibration to 'hear' the note.
Easy to use and accurate. Only issue in tuning Drop d or b on a 5 - String bass... it takes longer to find the sweet spot to tune it. It tends to fall off quickly on low notes. Microphone works well for acoustic guitars.
Works well as a tuner, but I did return it to buy the Korg tuner/metronome combo.  Thought it would be easier to have it all in one machine.  However, this worked fine as a plain tuner.
I have a lot of guitar tuners in the house. I've had few handheld units, some apps on my phone, the Korg Pitch Black, some Fender thing, the Boss TU-3, and the TC Electronic Polytune. I can say that the only tuner that I prefer over this one is the Pitch Black. This little CA1 is actually faster and better than the TU-3 by a hair, and absolutely kills the Polytune in speed and accuracy. Korg really knows how to build their tuners, and this one is a truly great one. Works great for acoustic guitars as well as electric, and also does a fine job on basses, too. I don't know if it's accurate enough for a piano, but it is what it is.
This is a nice tuner that works great. nice part is it works on ALL stringed instrument. I will tell you my 1st one did go belly up but Korg's awesome warranty covered it and my 2nd one works great. This is the tuner you want!
