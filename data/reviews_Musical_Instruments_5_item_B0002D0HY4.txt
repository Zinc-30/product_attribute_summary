Not a great mic, but if you need something realitively cheap, it'll do.  Limited dynamic range.  But, it works.  Wish I'd have gotten something a little nicer though.
This is my second SM48 in 25 years! What's the difference between the 58 and the 48? The 48 is made in Mexico. There is a noticeable difference in tone with the 48 with the on/off switch. (I did not buy that one) If feedback is an issue in your practice space, get the one with the switch, otherwise opt out for better clarity.I say go for it!! Save $50.
This mic is great! I have one I have used from coast to coast to coast to coast. Unbeatable in price and quality. You can't go wrong with a brand name like shure. I have had mine for 14 years and it still sounds like it just came out of the box. You will have no shame in your game with this in in your arsenal. As a veteran bluseman I recommend it. It rocks! As clean as a marsh 'possum.
I got these mics because I am in an environment where we needed the ON/OFF toggle on the microphone and - for us - it works great. These mics sound great for both normal speaking and singing in a small room. They sound similar to the Shure SM58 and we use them every day. They are still going strong.
This microphone is the best microphone I have ever owned. It is very dense, a little quiet, but the sound is absolutely brilliant quality. It is very clear sounding, and very well built. Get this mic. You will not regret it.
I like the durability of it, and the on/off switch. it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter. its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be, but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used. i haven't tried this through a PA live yet. i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little. im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on.
