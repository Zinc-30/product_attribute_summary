A perfect match for the original I replaced.  These fit the American sized pots perfectly.  The price at Amazon was the best I could find without buying used crap.
This is an original Gibson Gear replacement part. Don't change your knobs or any kind of part in your Gibson (Les Paul, SG or any other) if not for the real deal. I have a Les Paul and I definetely intend to maintain its value in the long term by using original parts. Besides, they look great and will perform their job for many, many years!
I replaced the metric pots in my Greco LP and needed new top hats. These look great and work perfectly.
I like replacing pickguards, truss rod covers, knobs, etc. on my guitars. This is a nice part.  Looks awesome on my Les Paul Traditional Desert Burst.
These are stylish and fit perfectly on my guitar.  They are even and not warped like the stock ones were.
