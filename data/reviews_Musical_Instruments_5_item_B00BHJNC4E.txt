Purchased this and a comparable Hosa cable. This cable works flawlessly without crackles when guitar is moved. Hosa failed the test in both performance and easy coiling. I will stick to GLS products from this point forward.
I ordered two of these cables and they arrived on time and as advertised.  They are excellent quality, clear tone and a great look.  I was actually impressed with the room that the cables gave my tone and the clarity they have.  For Price and Quality these are top notch.
Definitely the best combination of price, durability and sound quality that I've come across. Plus, the tweed look really grows on you.  Ordered a bunch for the studio, and a bunch more for home. Holds up well, even after being yanked and crushed and stepped on. Do it!
First of all, 20 ft is not too long. Better to have a little bit of extra length than too short. The cable works fine and is very flexible. Also looks nice and is easier to track than plain black ones. Recommended!
Constructed well, works perfectly, rolls up nicely with no kinks. The  20 foot guitar instrument cable is another quality product by GLS Audio.
