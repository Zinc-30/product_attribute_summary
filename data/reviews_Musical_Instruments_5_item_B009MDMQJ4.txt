I wasn't expecting much from this case; I bought it on a deployment to take a guitar back home with me that I had also order off Amazon that was of better quality then I had expected. This case is sweet! I love the black and crome, it looks great and the inside is well cusioned and really smooth. If you need a case don't even think twice about, this is a great one at a great price.
For the money, this is a great guitar case.  I bought it for a Silvertone SD10, which costs about $120.  The guitar fits it fine.  I use it to store my guitar around the house or put it in the back of the car to transport it.  I don't think I would take it on an airline.  They destroy luggage, so I don't think it would fair well.  The compartment inside is large enough for picks, strings, capo and a strap with room to spare.  Mine opens and closes ok and the lock works. It is well worth the $60 I paid for it.
it is a hardshell case, about what I expected, decent low end hardshell but serviceable. I wouldn't check in with an airline, I can lean on the top and push it in. for a little extra protection over a gig bag YES, don't put an amp on top of it in a van though.
Looked at a lot of cases most priced $90 or above.  Settled on this one because of price, reviews, and measurements posted here in the reviews that assured my my guitar would fit.  I have an Alvarez AD60 (dreadnaught style body) and it fits in this case nice and snug.  Solid, well padded, sturdy latches, and everything lines up.  Very happy with my purchase.
This is exactly what I was looking for the protect my investment.  I tried purchasing a soft case that had the Seagull logo on it and was advertized and fitting my guitar, it didn't.  It was way too short for my Seagull S-12 Coastline.  This is a sturdy case that looks good too.
