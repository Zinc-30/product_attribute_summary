I have a Fender T Bucket acoustic guitar and I put heavy guage strings on it. As beginner these strings were not good for me. I tried these and they blow away the heavy guage strings. Good quality. Glad I bought these.
Nice overall, with a good sustained ring from the steel strings (1-2) and a bit of a metalic sound on the wound strings (3-6).  I like the sound I get on my Yamaha acoustic.
I love these strings, I've tried others but I always come back to these, great for beginners, the phosphor Bronze provide a lower/deeper tone that I prefer, but still very bright.
I read the reviews on Ernie Ball strings. I have to say that I love the strings. They have a rich sound that brings my acoustic alive.
Who say's Ernie Ball can't make good Acoustic Strings. This set sounds just fine and for the money forget about itThanks Amazon! :o-)
What can I say, they are Ernie Ball Slinky strings. I've been using Slinkys on my acoustics and electrics for 40 years and they have never let me down- (Unlike some of the higher priced strings) I might add. Very responsive and never dull or weak sounding. Crisp highs and smooth lows that don't get &#34;mudded&#34; out. I would recommend these to anyone to at least try a set on your acoustic guitar and Ernie Ball Super Slinkys on your electric guitar. Still, after all of these years and innovations in strings, Ernie Ball still gets my vote hands down!!
