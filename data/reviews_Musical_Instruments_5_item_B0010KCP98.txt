I am running 4 big speakers it is working fine not sure it it is 1400 watts but runs a pair of 750 peak super pro 15 inch speakers and a pair of 12 road gear subs so far I get a big punch aout of it . I tough I had to buy two of this but one works fine. I am running a dj karaoke system. I also got a pyle pro 4 channel mixer and they work fine get cables it only comes with power cable. item received looks diferent I say better.
Our second week and all is WELL! Nice and quiet. Using Speakon Cables (Mono) to each Speaker to Speaker for easy mixing. XLR to XLR from Mackie Mixer to PylePRO 1400 Watt amp. Great value for the Garage Band and recording to the computer for publishing on Web or using as a small GIG amp. Think I will get another one for the Stage Monitors. Might as well go ALL-IN!
As I've heard with the Pyle Pro amps, I received mine today, and it was defective. Only one channel worked, and it definitely looked like it took a beating before it arrived at my doorstep. The packaging was very good though, so I'm  thinking this looks like a refurb/used, and they listed it as new. Already printed the return shipping label, and it will head back to the Amazon warehouse on Monday...
This amp did a good job for its rating. It was my backup amp for a QSC GX5. I sold it after using it for about a year or so.
Nice amp for the money but couldn't push a single Peavey SP218 Sub, so I moved this amp to push a pair of dual 15's, still had trouble getting the range that I needed, so I have this amp now as a back up and will probally use it for powering a single EV18 sub rated at 500 watts, it should handle it nicely bridged, I will keep you posted.
