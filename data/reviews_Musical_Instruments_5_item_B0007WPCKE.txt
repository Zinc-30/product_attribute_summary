It's a very solidly made stand. Simple to assemble. Perfect for my home studio, holding my 88 key midi controller keyboard. I'm very happy with the purchase and the price was right.
I'm using it for my Alesis Q49 MIDI keyboard.  Folds up easy so I can tuck it away.  It may not work with a keyboard smaller than 49 keys.  As you lower it the support spreads out wide.  Good quality.  Adjustable height and for the dept of the keyboard.
Great stand, holds my mid sized keyboard up very well.  Not sure how it works for some behemoths but for the basic setup its fine.
This works exactly as intended, and is a perfect size for my MS2000.  Not really sure what the going price is on other stands, but I'm very happy with what I paid for it.  No worries of my synth falling over or anything like that, the only issue I had was with putting it together at first.  The picture in the instructions was kind of hard to figure out, because there are different sized bars that were kind of difficult to interpret.  But it was probably more of my error, and even with that it just meant I had to unscrew them and screw in the right ones.
This keyboard is pretty dope. I bought this a while back when I bought my Samson 49 key midi keyboard. It's been a little over 2 years and I've used it ever since. I recommend this to anyone buying a keyboard in the future or currently. You can't go wrong with this stand.
