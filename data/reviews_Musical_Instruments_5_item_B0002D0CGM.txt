These picks are nice and thin, just what I was looking for in a pick.  They seem durable so far and the light color makes them easy to see when you drop one or set it down.  I'm satisfied with these picks.
This picks are comfortable, nice quality. They'll get dirty as they are cream (or white as I see) but worth it!! Wanna play fast? take these n try em out
These picks have just the right amount of give to really make strumming sound nice and clean. Very forgiving on technique also. Great for beginners.
I only use Dunlops. For a number of reasons. First, the texture of the plastic gives a good sound, and easier to hold on to. Second, the "grippy" texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to. Thirdly, they make many sizes, for all the right occasions. Two thumbs up! Use these for general acoustic guitar strumming, they are not too thin and not too thick. I use the .60mm, .48mm, and .38mm. sizes.
i purchased the .38mm and these (.46mm).  after using the .38mm and learning how to use the pick now i feel better using these.  i like the small amount of texture provided in the grip area.  not too much, but at least something.
Normally I prefer a harder pick but I switch to these after 9pm when playing my acoustic guitar to keep the peace with the neighbors. These super light flexible nylon picks are great if you're trying to play quietly. If you prefer a flexible, softer pick as many people do these are also excellent for your regular go to pick.
ive been using dunlop nylon standard picks since the early 80s. they have never let me down. very comfortable in the hand.
