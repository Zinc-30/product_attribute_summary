Works awesome :)
Can't complain about a price like this!!! Does the job just fine for what it is, not really anything more you could ask for.  Comes with the proper attachment pieces that you need for most (if not all) microphones, folds up nice and small.  Happy all around!
We bought this stand for our son's new guitar amp Mic, and it works fine for his set-up. It comes with the Mic clip to hold the Mic as well. The height adjustments seem to work flawlessly.
Good unit for the money, for sure.  It is not road worthy however, in our opinion.  Still, for any smaller gigs, it does a fine job.  Delivery, packaging etc were very good.
Needed boom arm stands and these filled the bill.  Tripod base to get over stage cables, and a boom arm with clips.  Works just fine.  Be sure to check is the length of the arm is OK.  These are slightly shorter than other stands I have.
