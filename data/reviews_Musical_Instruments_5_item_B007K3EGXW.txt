I put these on an Epiphone Les Paul acoustic-electric and it sounds so great. They are very smooth and warm and magical, like a mythical unicorn.
Great strings, the strings on my Epiphone Les Paul wore out so i bought these, my ukulele sounds better than when i first bought it. Kinda wish they came in black, the white contrasts with the color of my uke.
Best strings for my ukulele. These are great quality. I only use Aquila strings on my instruments. Highly recommended. My ukulele has a better tone with these strings.
If you buy a ukulele, and it does not have these strings, you should replace them with these strings. Strings make a big difference in any ukulele.
However I have found that there are much better prices out there if you just do some basic searching.  Usually I do. My bad.
These strings are the best.  Haven't found any others that sound and feel so good.  They lasted 3 years and I play nearly every day for hours.  Go figure!  I actually thought I didn't need to change strings (still don't know for sure) because they still sounded so good and show no wear.  Anyway I decided to change the strings because it's been so long.  Happy that I did however.
I have three uku, soprano, concert ( Love the best ) and a tenor,,  this brand of strings rocks.  enjoy
Aquila strings will never let you down. Highly recommended by all serious Ukulele players. Italian made, need I say more.
