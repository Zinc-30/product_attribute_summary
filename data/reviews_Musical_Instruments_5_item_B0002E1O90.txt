I have tried many types of steel strings.  My Taylor 355 came delivered with these - and though I have tried several others, I have returned to them.  Their ease of play (smoothness to fret and finger) and light but rich tonality makes them a good choice for your 12-string.  Haven't tried 'em yet?  Pick up a set - they ARE different and, in many ways, better than the more standard Phosphor Bronze strings that were the best before these came along.
I own aTaylor Guitars 355-CE Jumbo 12 String Acoustic Electric Guitarand it came with these strings on it. 12 string guitars are generally hard to play for long periods of time, so they might not get as much use as a regular 6 string. The tone from these strings is just as bright and clear 8 months later, and they still hold their tuning like they after the first 2 days. Elixir strings are in general more expensive than other major brands - but the extra few bucks are worth it because the sounds stays so clear and consistent after extensive use. They are great strings on any guitar.
Changing strings on a 12 string less often? Fantastic!!  And the sound is good. I didn't expect this much volume from light strings. The tone of the strings lasts about 4 months, in my experience, but that will depend on how much playing you get in.
WOW, is putting it mildly when you here the quality sound that these strings produce on a 12 string.Endless beauty when you here the tones produced by Elixer. Elixer strings are more expensive than other strings but well worth the higher price tag. You can not go go with a set or two of Elixers.
These strings are great for a 12 string. I started using coated strings on all of my guitars last year and have gotten use to the smooth feel. A 12 string is a little harder on the fingers so the coating is nice to have. They sound as bright and clean as any uncoated string I have used on this guitar. And I think they will last longer. Which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring!
