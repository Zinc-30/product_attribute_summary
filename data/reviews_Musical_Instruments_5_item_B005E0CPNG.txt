Just as the others have said.  Its cheap with little to no padding but gets the job done as a dust cover and if you need something handy to transport your bass to and from gigs or to put the bass into storage.Its a perfect fit for Fender Squire J Bass.  I also got my Samick CR-13 short scale to fit in there but it was a tight fit so not the ideal choice for Short Scale bassesBut Im happy with it for under eleven bucks it gets the job done and I would buy it again
This bag is super cheap and flimsy with almost no protection for your guitars at all but since it's reflected in the cost.
this is very easy to put the guitar in to because it zips around the whole end and can be carried in your back
Keeps gear dry.Not for airplane travel or shipping, but perfect for spare guitars.Zipper works fine; fabric as good as gig bags three times as much.
I recently purchased a Epiphone EB-3 bass and it didn't come with a case/bag. So when I found this one and decided for the price it was worth the try. It is VERY thinly padded not much more then a dust cover really. Not to mention that it has issues fitting a side by side into the bag but inlines seem to fit just fine. All in all it's an okay bag but only if you have an inline and don't want much padding.
