usually picks are picks, but these are a blast, I play by holding the "horns" between thumb and forefinger and using the mouth to pick out the notes, I had to order 2 extra bags of these because people keep begging for one.
these picks are nice. They're great for metal, if you like a durable pick. The paint fade away after a while, but don't let that stop you. It leave no residue on your guitar and these have never broken on me. the only reason i would buy more is if i lost some over time.
These picks play about like a regular triangular pick, the rounded ears may be more practical for some players.  They stand out because everyone loves the idea of them.  I would definitely recommend any serious player own one pack of these, and carry one around because they always get a good laugh.
I like these picks.  They look great, and work well.  I have no issues at all with them, and they play a little stiff when new, but within minutes feel like an old friend.  Great buy for $3.  Give one to a guitar playing friend and watch eyes open wide with a "NO WAYYY!" look on their face!!
I am a big fan of the movie &#34;Tenacious D and the Pick of destiny&#34; so when I saw these picks I just had to get them!
Bought as a stocking stuffer for my brother in law. Gave it to him with an actual replica of the pick. He loved them. Still has some.
I figured I would take 2mins out of servicing the line of ladies that formed after receiving this pic to do a review.  The pics shape and thickness is actually perfect (TWSS) for playing and gripping.  Also the paint seems to be holding after quite a few hours of playing.  I would suggest getting two packs since you will need 1 pick and the other 11 can go to the children you fathered due to this pic.
