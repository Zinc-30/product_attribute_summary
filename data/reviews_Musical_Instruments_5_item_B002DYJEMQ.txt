Pack of 10 guitar picks - check"Meet the Beatles" theme - checkRetail packaging - checkTwo-day delivery (got it the next day... thanks to Prime) - checkHappy guitarist - checkI can't really complain about anything, except maybe for the price.  But then again, I didn't HAVE TO buy these.  They are fun and kitschy.  5-stars.
This was a gift for a friend who is a Beatles fan. I bought him two different types he he liked them both. These will not be used much.
I just got these to collect not to use to play with. They look good and anyway planet waves has good stuff.
For some reason these picks have a better feel, flexibility and grip than any I have found in a long time. They aren't that expensive (especially as an add-on) and they're relly cool.
i'd say these are a pretty neat thing to have in your pick collection. i don't use them all too often because they're a bit too stiff though.
If you use a medium pick for playing these are really cool picks to play with and about the same price as a fender or dunlop medium pick.  For a Beatles collector what a great price for a neat Beatles product.  Even the packaging it cool.If you need picks for playing or a neat Beatles product to collect you won't be dissipointed with this purchase.Excellent product from a fantastic seller.
I JUST RECEIVED MY 10 PACK PLANET WAVES BEATLE COLLECTORS PICK, GRAPHICS ARE GREAT, IT'S A GREAT LITTLE COLLECTION, ONLY THING THAT I DIDN'T LIKE WAS THAT YOU DIDN'T GET 15 SEPARATE ONES, THEY ARE ALL DUPLICATES, SO BESIDES THAT THEY ARE GREAT
