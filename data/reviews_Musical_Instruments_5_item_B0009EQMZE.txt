It's not bad. It would be better if I bought one large enough for my finger. Still, I'd rather stick with a Copper slide.
I purchased this as my first guitar slide. I loved it for about one month, then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces. I almost cut myself! I will never buy a glass slide again, I recently bought a Dunlop brass slide and love it. The difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier, mellow tone, and glass is crisper, louder, and does not break. I would not suggest this to anyone. The metal ones are about the same price, they don't break, and sound way better. There's a reason ALL pros use metal! The review below is wrong. Slides are meant to cover your ENTIrE finger, all the way to the tip. You don't bend your finger to play slide. You retune your guitar to an open tuning. Just thought I would point that out.
A little small for my taste, very thin, but works well and Dunlop products have always peased me as a professional musician.
This is a great glass slide, but the ring size seems to be smaller than announced. My finger stays too tight. Not uncomfortable, but it takes some effort to get it out.
Clear sounding slider works pretty good in the studio. I did drop it a couple times (ok, maybe more than a couple) on the wood floors of stages without a problem. Then one day, in the frigidly cold outdoors, I dropped it on a concrete floor and it completely shattered, oops.
I'll start this by saying I prefer metal slides to glass (tone snob that I am)So I wasn't too excited about playing with this, until I played with it!The tone is amazing!!Great highs, amazing lows, smooth midrange and unbelievable harmonics!I now only use metal slides... And my dunlop bottleneck ;-)
