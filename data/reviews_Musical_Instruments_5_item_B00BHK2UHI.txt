These are durable, but I get some noise from the cables. It's barely audible, but it's distracting nonetheless.
The cable tangles easily. Not stiff enough.It get's in the way and is hard to stay stretched out. But the color and the cloth cover is cool looking and has a more personal feel than the common rubber types. It also seem tightly put together at the ends.
Satisfies my needs . . . nice cloth covered, large strain relied, good plugs (put a bit of thread lock on them they unscrew almost unintentionally) . . . . like it even if it's a bit long for use at home.
A friend made a comment that the cord looked like an old iron electric cord. LOL The cord delivers good sound quality. The only problem I have with it is that it gets tangled up rather easy.
This is a great guitar cable its very long and does not get tangles up no matter how hard you try I recommend it to anybody who wants a good cable.
Very nice quality. I've removed 1 star because of the 1/4 casing. The sheath likes to twist off a little too easily. I used plumbers thread tape and tightened it right up. Other than that. I've been using this cable regularly for a while and it works great.
