I bought it by mistake cause I don't own nor play the bass but it works for my guitar..fits well!! good quality too!
This is a convenient way to keep your picks close in case you drop one or need to chance to different pick weight.  I don't have a bass, however, it fits great on my acoustical and electric guitar.
Good idea. Tends to slip on the strings however. Convenientt to have a pick at the end of the neck.
If you're a bass player and use a pick, you need one of these. If you are a bass player and *sometimes* use a pick, you *really* need one of these! I bought one for every bass and a spare.Wedgies work better on bass than guitar, because the strings are thicker and usually parallel. I have a guitar wedgie on my gibson explorer, and it is a bit loose because of the angled headstock spreading the strings--but the bass ones stay put.Really, these things are great.
I usually keep pick in my mouth when I don't use them but sometimes I drop them, and at a show you do not have time to bend down and grab it, so this is a nice option to have a spare one, if you use bass picks, get this, it is bigger than the guitar version, much like the picks.
