Acquired a 1993 strat without a trem and ordered this one. It fits perfect and even though I'm not a huge whammy user it's nice to have for that occasional vibrato.

Du Du .Duh Duh!Hendrix, bro.This arm fit my Mexican Strat perfectly.  I then sold it to a beginner guitarist for a great price.  I firmly believe that this small investment of vibrato arm greatly increased my return.  The only problems is that I'm not sure I can afford to pay the capital gains tax for all the profit that I made on my guitar investment.  I might have to sell one of my Lexuses.. Lexi.. what the hell is the plural of Lexus?
Say it all, but the replacement is milled finer and has better threads than the original piece.  A great upgrade when adding new parts to the inexpensive but fantastic Squire.
This arm is a direct replacement for the original.....  It is a bit to long for my liking and I may shorten it down in the near future.
this tremolo arm needed to be bent outwards a bit in order for it screw down enough while still clearing the volume and tone controls, overall a pretty good purchase
It works as advertised.  Replaced missing tremolo bar.  I don't normally use one, but if I ever wanted to sell the Strat I would want to sell it complete.
Very nice quality part.  Fit the trem very snugly until some of the chrome plating was removed. But my Mexi-Strat is now complete.
