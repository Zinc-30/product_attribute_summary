they do the job great not a bad price for as many as you getgoing to buy some more for sure
I use to protect my microphones ...... of karaoke singers because they sing spit and that creates bad smell in the microphone .... very good product I recommend
They're round and they fit over microphones.  Work well to stop pops and lisps.  Have been very happy with them.
These foam mike covers do exactly what they are made to do, and they do it just about average as you expect. My only complaint is they come packaged in a bag that allows them to be crushed and mis-shaped upon delivery. If your mike has a big enough ball, the ball will reshape the foam. Otherwise the foam will never have that nice smooth, round look to it.
Nothing Fancy. Snug Fit for my Mic. Kinda of thin compared to others that I have seen. Bought extras in case others wanted to use my Mic.
So I have these old EV mics and the little foam piece on the inside of the ball dry rotted and crumbled.  These provided an easy inexpensive solution.  No complaints.
