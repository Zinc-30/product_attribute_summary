These balanced patch cables are great.  This is the third set of various music cables I've purchased from this brand and they are all great quality for the price.  Love their XLR microphone cables too.
Ok, 6 TRS patch cables, 6' long each for $30.00? I was skeptical when I purchased these, but I'm happy that I did and will soon be ordering at least 6 more.  Absolutely no noise from my mixer to my stand-alone recorder or to my computer-based interface.Excellent value.Update:  I just received another set of these cables.  I'm extremely happy with the build quality and performance.  I'll be looking at additional items from this company.
I recently bought these for my home studio, so far so good, keyboards to mixer. They are a little flimsy, but so far no problems, have extras if necessary, high end cables also break down. They were packaged very good and the cable wraps are a plus. For the price and selection and results, works for me.
The title says it all.  There is literally no better deal on the net for the quality you receive!  I've been using my cables very happily for 2 months now with no problems!  If you're looking for some good TRS cables....look no further!!
I bought the TS version of these cables, and they have served me well, These are of the same quality, and a great value for the price.
They look nice and do the job perfectly well.  The price is not too bad.  The colours help with organization.
Besides that fact that they are quality cables, the colors are pretty dope and really stand out nicely in the studio.
