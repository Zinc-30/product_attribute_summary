This is a great item because it is small, lightweight and portable and it clips on anywhere (guitar, mic stand etc.) At the same time, because it is so lightweight it is prone to breakage if you give it hard use and don't pack it carefully when traveling etc..  The clip that holds the paper to the corrugated plastic clipboard is very strong.  The clip that goes to the mic stand is also strong but if you leave it on the stand for months at a time it will weaken and start to slide if you put more than 1-2 sheets of paper on the clip board. This doesn't happen tho if you remove the clip at the end of the gig, day etc.  For this price it's a good buy in my opinion and with a little care, you will get more than your money's worth out of it.
This doesn't look very robust, I expect it will work well in my home studio but if my kids get with in 6ft of it; consider it broken. The swivle hinge is secure and will hold it's position as well as the clamp but they could not have been made any more marginally weak.The backing board mine came with is about 2/3 the size of a full sheet of paper, make what you will of that... and mine is actually secured to the clamp with dual side adhesive so separating them would be a chore and a risk.Overall, a reasonable value and I'm glad I bought it.
It is what it is. Works. Works as expected and should last a really really long time. Glad I bought it.
i got this to hold set lists and lyrics on stage and at rehearsal.  the clipboard is small and wont hold more than a few sheets but is great for holding a set list and one or two sheets of lyrics or chord charts.  i hang it down from the boom and it is inconspicuous and suits my needs just fine so far.
These a cheaply made with corrugated plastic, however they are surprisingly durable. THESE ARE NOT 8.5x11 (paper size). They are about half-sheet size.
