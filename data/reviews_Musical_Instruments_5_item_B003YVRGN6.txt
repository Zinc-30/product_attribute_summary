I love this guitar!! It has a terrific sound and it's GORGEOUS!  The gig bag, although not padded, works very well and is well made.  The pockets are very handy.  All in all...one of the best purchases I've made for the money.  VERY HAPPY!!
I believe I've rated this instrument before.  I really like that it plays easily and has a good sound to it.  I also like the fact that it doesn't require a 9 Volt Battery whereas others I played did.  I would buy from this company again and probally will in the future.  Thank You.
This is an amazing guitar. I couldn't put it down, I have experience playing really, really expensive guitars. My $500 "beater" acoustic I was just going to take to the beach and stuff actually got warped and never played well at all, I couldn't imagine what I would b getting for $90. By was I wrong. It's my best acoustic currently! This thing sounds like, sustains, and holds its' own tune like a similar $2000.00+ Martin model and that's ZERO exaggeration! Get it and see, you will be blown away. I bought a second one. I just wish I had found this guitar sooner.
This is a good beginner or intermediate guitar but if you play for profit get something better. Cheap case but does at least fit the guitar. I like it but I'm just playing for entertainment and at church some times. Electronics are just volume, and tone but it rocks my little battery powered Honeytone amp. Nice finish, nice guitar.. For the money ; )
Right out of the box, playable!  I did a tune up of the strings and they are holding pitch well after a couple of hours of playtime.  The electronics are just fine on the guitar I got.  I did have to adjust the string action down a bit, but hey, that goes with the territory.  There were some minor flaws in the finish, but for the money spent, this is a real workhorse and plays great!
