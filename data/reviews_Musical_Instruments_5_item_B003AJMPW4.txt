This was a gift for a friend who is a fan of the Beatles. He was very happy with his gift.
I got these for my dad for Christmas. He loved them all and won't quit playing with them. I figured he would put them into his collection of cool things he's amassed, but he uses them daily to play the Ibanez acoustic/electric I got him.
What's not to like? 15 Beatles picks. A super cool little tin. Rocks my world and back to the garden!
Not only are these great picks to look at they are great picks to use. I love the picks, the tin they come in and the ease of use.
If you are a Beatle fan this is such a cute item. Was more than I expected for the price. Nice for collectable or to use.
Planet Waves Signature guitar picks - always the best, always reliable. An excellent useful product that I not only use myself, but often give as gifts to other musicians. - Michael Haller, 'Captain Soul's Sound Circus'
I was very pleased when I got my Beatles Tin and Collector Picks. The service was good and prompt and the price was very reasonable. I was surprised at how cool both the Tin and the Picks were, they are a real talking point and a must have for Muso's who like individual items in their collection. Thanks again Cheers !!!
For whatever reason I excpected the tin to be a little larger then what it is.  I thought the size of an Altoid tin.  I was thinking I could not only store the fifteen Beatles picks, but also store my hundred other picks in the tin.It is very nice looking tin and the picks are cool,  well worth the just under $8.00 price tag. I may order another one with different print on the tin, but it is a small tin.  Just a little larger than a zippo lighter.
If your a Beatle fan or just someone who collects picks, This is the perfect item for you, Great graphics, I'm a guitar pick collector, And this is by far the best that i have, So if you don't have this Beatle set go and get it.
