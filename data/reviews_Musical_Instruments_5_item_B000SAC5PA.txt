Guitar bag fit over my Fender T Bucket guitar. Cheap price and does the job. It has just enough padding and heavy duty nylon to protect my acoustic from being scratched. Worth $24.
Haven't used it yet, but it looks nice and came quicker than expected. So far so good! I recommend it.
I'm a new user, but seem to be a Great product!!!! Can't complaint!!! I finally got it and saw how great it is. It has plenty of roomy pockets, great padding, and is put together with great quality.
Very easy to get the guitar into and seems to protect the instrument very well.  Exactly as described in the ad.
ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home "12/23/11" and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset, i would not returned because i don't feel like fighting with no body but they shouldn't do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for.
This bag is made well enough. If you are careful it offers good protection. You can't rely on this bag alone if you are going to toss the guitar around and you certainly can't stack anything on it but it will prevent dings and scratches from occasional bumps etc. If your guitar is priceless than you should upscale your gig bag, otherwise it's a good bag, especially at this price.
I'm very happy when I got this gig bag. Good quality and Thik cussion. Good enough to travel around this world with peace of mind.Best price with free shipping! That's good enough? Finish your serch and buy this one. I highly recomended this. PS.-this gig bag cannot fit full size guitar, OK?
