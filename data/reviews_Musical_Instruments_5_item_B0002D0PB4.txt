Last forever and easy to hold onto.  Not much more to say but there really isnt much more that needs to be said.  My favorite picks.
Great all round pick, one of my favorites.  Easy to grip and are pretty quite.  They wear out extremely fast though.
I recently bought a bunch of picks of different gauges and materials for a shoot out. I think you have to see what kind of tone you are looking for - yes, even in a pick (sorry guys! - but for me, this material and gauge had a full sound, without being thin and the material feels best in the fingers. (I previously used .63 gauge acetal Claytons.
I like these pics.  I use a variety of thickness and this are moderately thin.  good for fast strumming, etc.  they feel good in your hand and are easy to hold onto.  I would buy them again.
Years ago I used the Clayton &#34;small teardrop&#34; picks. I couldn't tell from the picture, that these were full size, and I didn't check the size in the description.  I still had a few of the small ones, so I used them as templates, to cut these down. I would have rated them higher, if I could have used them as is. It's my own fault for not looking at the specifications. I purchased two six packs of Clayton Teardrop picks, but found Dunlop 423R60 0.60mm (Orange) Tortex Small Tear Drop Guitar Picks, 36-Pack which are a lot cheaper.
Clayton's rule! Been using since they debuted and will never change to anything else.Long lasting and great tone besides.Awesome.yes,indeed.khjghjjh hgkjhgk
