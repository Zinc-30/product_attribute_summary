A friend gave me a few of these and overall I like them.  I'd give them 3.5 stars if I could.  Having said that, I don't like them as much as a regular nylon pick.  The star hole just feels a bit weird to me, though I could probably get used to it.  I'm glad I got to try these, but these won't replace my favorite nylon picks.
I usually use fender .73 picks but they seemed to fall out of my fingers while I was playing and it was very irratating. So I picked these up. I no longer have to worry about them falling out of my hand. The star in the middle allows your fingers to connect in the star and you are able to get a good and stable grip on it. Hands down the best pick I've used.
I guess I have tried about every type of pick around. Thick ridged things with thin strumming edges, great big triangles oh do you remember cork circles on one side? Look this is just easy, the star hole means I grip it and it doesn't move until I let go. Never had one break and the gauge being marked is so much nicer than digging through the "pick pen" on the counter of the local music store trying to find 3 that feel right. Yup 3 'cause they were three for $1.00
I used to use the Tortex pick until a buddy of mine gave me one of these.  I ended up using that pick for something like 3 years (playing 1-2 times/wk).  Once I started playing 4hrs/wk at my church, I decided that this pick had proven its self so I order a small box.  I have never dropped one of these and have never broken one.  FYI: I generally don't play hard and I always play acoustic, Nanoweb custom lights.
First saw on YouTube video, how genius? A pick that stays in hand... Makes me wonder how ever played without them...Small price for big help!
I say this one is more between a Fender Medium and heavy. But it has the star for grip and that is super. Hard not to like. Get some!
