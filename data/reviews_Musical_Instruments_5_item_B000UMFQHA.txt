I'm using this in V1 in a 5 watt tube amp.  It's really nice.  I tried the NOS route and I much prefer this tube.  The other good thing is it comes in a box from JJ, unlike some tubes from other places I've ordered where they seem to lose their original boxes along the way and it looks like everyone and their brother has been messing with them.
I have a VOX AC4TV. It uses (stock) a 12AX7, but I thought I would try the 12AT7 just to see what happened. I had read that this type of tube could give you more clean headroom.After a little test run, my first impression was that the amp was noticeably quieter with this tube installed. It might have reduced the volume by a third or more - but this came with the benefit of the amp being noticeably less noisy. That was a nice benefit.I didn't notice much of a change tonally. I think this tube basically brought the volume down. I wouldn't say this is better or worse than the 12AX7, just quieter, and with significantly less output.I ended up switching back to the 12AX7.
I bought this tube to test in a friends Fender HRD in the PI spot. He wanted more clean tone and was willing to have less overall gain. He liked the result when I switched out the GT 12AX7. I want to try a JAN 12AT7 next, but the JJ is doing a good job for now. Also interested in swapping out his GT (Sovtek) 5881's for JJ 6L6GC's.
I found this tube to sound pleasant, be cheaper in cost than the Electro-Harmonix, and work, unlike the Electo-Harmonix tubes I received.
JJ's are great tubes! This 12AT7 replaced a 12AX7 in the preamp of an Epi Valve Jr to soften the gain and sweeten the tone- it was very nice, but I found an old American made 12AU7 that I like more- the JJ is still a great tube.
