although im not onstage bouncing aroung...they hold the strap on just fine...no changing hardware like strap locks...yes..more colors so they would stay hidden would be nice...but i will order more..
so I never had the luxury of the Grolsch brand strap locks.I tried to raid the water bottles at the local cafe, but alas, I was too slow.It's a bit hard to forge a strap lock out of a Carlsberg bottle cap.So the Fender ones will do just fine, plus they come in 2 colors and say Fender.Time to open another Carlsberg, cheers Fender.
My Epiphone SST Classic didn't have the strap pin, so I took it to a place where they put the pin in the wrong place, as I don't want to do another hole to my guitar, I left it there, but I'm afraid that the strap would come off and my guitar hit the ground, so I bought these Fender strap blocks, and I use it on my two Epiphone guitars that I can't use the Planet Waves Strap lock with. My other Epiphone guitar is an Epiphone Hummingbird.They work great!! I would buy these again.
This is a good product. These work very well and are inexpensive and easy enough to put on. I like.
An amazing cheap solution but the dunlop strap pins are the best way to go overall but i defiantly trust these on my guitar. 2 months and no problems yet
