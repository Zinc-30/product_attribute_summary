It is exactly as represented. It does a fine job. I have used it in recording live band practice sessions. I would if necessary purchase this item again.
This is another adapter that I rarely use and now that I have a digital mixer I am not sure if I will ever get much use out of them with my rig. Traveling about to use some other rig though you never know what you might run into so I plan on keeping these little artifacts for a while longer.
You can't have too many adapters if you are a sound guy. This handy gadget converts a balanced or unbalanced mic cable to an unbalanced 1/4" jack. Simple and it works. I've got a couple in my kit and they do what they say and come in handy when working with unknown equipment.
I didn't need anything high dollar so this was just what I needed.  Does have a cheaper feel than the other (much more expensive units I've used).
These plugs are well made and serve the purpose they were intended for. If I buy more in the future I will be checking here first.
Took a while to find what I needed but this is what I needed!  Free shipping.  Exactly what I needed at a great price!
I notice mixed reviews here.  I suppose when an item sells for $2 instead of $20 there may be a potential for quality control issues.  But hey, buy 3 of them and if even one turns out to be bad, you're still way ahead on the deal.  Seems to me as good as any connector I've ever bought.
