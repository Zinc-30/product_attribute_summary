i use this pedalwith my acoustic guitar and it just sounds great, for the price and quality sound i can not get a better deal.behringer pedals and joyo pedals are definitely the best for the price and quality.thank u guys.
I have other Behringer products and have never encountered any issues operating them.  I use a power snake instead of batteries so I cannot comment on battery life or compartment access.  The box is plastic but that is not really a hinderence.
I ordered this pedal based on the previous review, but to me it sounds cheap and faint. I do a have a few Behringer pedals and many are very good for the price, but this one I won't be keeping. To me, it wasn't even close to as good as what you get on Fender amps or on my TC Electronics Delay pedal (which includes chorus/vibrato), and I thought that I would go solo with this pedal, but for me it's a no go...
Needed some chorus in my tone and this fit my budget. I have owned multiple Behringer products and trust the brand. It is a plastic casing but I don't tour so that won't be a problem - I needed the effect and it gives it. Fully adjustable for depth, tone, warble and volume. Don't spend $200 on a 'boutique' pedal - get this one.
I wanted to add a chorus to my effects chain and since I have mostly Behringer products (and am more than satisfied with my other pedals) decided to try the CO400. Again I am more than satisfied. A chorus isn't something you use all the time so I expect this one to give me years of good Behringer reliability and service. For someone looking for that extra color in your sound  try this pedal.I think you'll be pleasantly surprised and you sure can't beat the price. A great value for your money.
