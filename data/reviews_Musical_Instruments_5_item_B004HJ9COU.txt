The cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes. I don"t like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time I used it. The cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and I lost sound. This cable is complete garbage. Never again!
Cable would be O.K. If the end connections would stay screwed together. Maybe some lock tight would help. These connectors worry me.
I was a bit skeptical at first to purchase this. But its a nice cable! No noise or hum whatsoever!
I don't do heavy gigging just home studio play but I have had no issues with quality or sound.  It looks cool and sounds just fine and clear.  I like the metal connecters, they are easy to plug in and pull out at have a nice heft.It is not a super high quality cord but it does an excellent job for the price.  I will be buying these again.
The product was exactly what was advertised and completely filled the Job it was intended for. service was more than expected
