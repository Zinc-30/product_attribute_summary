Have used them for years, bought some new guitars, had to have.  Wish they had something for Acoustic Electric 1/4&#34; backplug
These on my guitar as a replacement to some old ones and they work well.  I have had no problems with them.
I put them on a Dipinto Mach V with that Levis Rat fink guitar strap I need to exchange. I use this on all my guitars. I tried some off brands and I've found it worth the extra few dollars to get the real deal.
About ten years ago, I installed strap locks on my first guitar (Fender Stratocaster). They worked well and were easy to install. I subsequently installed Dunlop strap locks on many other guitars with mixed results: the screws are really small and they would some times get stuck in the middle of installation. I had to drill additional holes no two guitars (Gibson SGs). Ouch.This made me take a second look at Schaller. The components, beginning with the screws, are of much higher quality than Dunlop. It took me ten years to realize that I made the wrong choice. I should have gone with Schaller from the beginning. I have replaced all my strap locks with Schaller with excellent results.
I just bought a Rickenbacker 4003 that came with Schaller strap locks pre-installed.  I've used Dunlops before, but those would require redrilling the holes to put them on the bass, so I just bought the Schaller buttons.  I don't quite like their look as well as the large round Dunlops, but there's no question about the quality -- these are not going to fall off the bass anytime soon.
