0	0	1	this acer monitor is nice looking.  the display is very bright with no dead pixels.  i don't use this monitor in a gaming arena so i can't comment on refresh rates in a gaming environment.  it is used on a family pc for internet, homework and watching movies.  it is well suited for that.  in bright daylight near a window, the display has a perfect brightness.  at night with normal ambient light - too bright. the controls are a little awkward for me.  there are double buttons to make adjustments.  i am still dialing it in for the best overall appearance.  the text at higher resolution is not as clear as i would hope, but i got the vga version and not the dvi.  i would recommend this monitor to anyone that wants a decent monitor but does not want to spend hundreds of dollars.
1	0	1	i just love this no nonsense acer 19inch widescreen monitor. it was easy to set up and the picture is crisp. i did have to adjust the clarity to my liking, again this was simple with the buttons right on the front. i have external speakers on my computer so the fact that this monitor has no speakers suits me fine. i am not a gamer, but rather do a lot of word processing and surfing. all in all, the price is great, the warranty is for three years, the screen is crisp and bright, all the ingredients for one happy camper! i, with clear conscience, recommend this monitor!
2	0	1	i am using this monitor with an acer laptop.  quality and image are adequate, but well below my hp w2007 monitor.
3	0	1	have an acer laptop so was familiar with the name.  since i had the very old fashioned 15" monitor, this was very different for me.  i can lift it with one hand.  the best thing that i can say is the monitor performs as advertised.  that means my money was well spent and i'm very satisfied with the product.  i'd buy another acer product and use amazon again.
4	0	1	i'm a day trader so i trade stocks from home for a living. i'm liking the reviews on this, so i'm pretty sure i'm going to be getting 3 of them. there's so much market information flying by every second and so many windows that you need open at once, so i think 3 of these would be perfect for me.
5	0	1	product was received quickly and it is just right for me!  easy to read screen and i don't think you can get a better monitor for the price.
6	0	1	this was a great buy. i love the fact that it is thin and easy to handle. i was surprised at the quality of the picture for such a cheap price.
7	0	1	works great.  hooked up to a laptop no problems. the picture is fantastic.  so much so, we just ordered the 22 inch for my wife.
8	0	1	this screen is a lot smaller than i thought it would be - my fault.  but since it's widescreen the 19" doesn't make nearly as large as i imagined.  it's only 1" taller than my old 15".  quite tiny.  i was really looking for a big bump up in size and didn't get it.  keep this in mind when looking at sizes.  my other issue is the legs - because of the way they angle - i cannot get my keyboard right up under the monitor.  this is annoying because acer could have chosen any number of leg configurations what wouldn't interfer with keyboards.  other than that - the monitor is fine.  it's bright and the resolution is good for both work stuff and fun stuff.  i streamed some tv shows off a network site recently and the quality was fine - if a bit tiny.  the widescreen was nice since the tv show was shot in widescreen.  the widescreen is also nice for the design software i use for work stuff since there a zillion property boxes that i can set off to the side now that i can't do when i work from the office.  also, the order came nice and quick - unlike many non-amazon amazon sellers.  smaller than i expected or wanted.  remember - widescreen makes the height smaller than you might think.
9	0	1	this monitor was really easy to set up...just plug it in, no software or adjustments were needed.  i don't do any gaming, etc. so i can't really comment on those aspects, but for wordprocessing programs it's great.  i've had no problems using it with vista, without vista and even with my favorite old stand by dos program.  also, mine was delivered through tiger direct ahead of schedule and in excellent condition.
10	0	1	great monitor, glad we bought it.  still trying to get used to a wide monitor probably should have gone with a square monitor -would have been less change from old crt version.
11	0	1	i have purchased two acer monitors one 22 inch and another 19 inch great clear and crisp pictures quick hookups.  has good lines in its look and complements my desk and computer system.  i have purchased a second 22 inch acer monitor and will purchase more.
12	0	1	i will withdraw my review if i'm incorrect about this, but i purchased this monitor to use with my samsung nc10 netbook, and it wouldn't connect.  the instructions and troubleshooting were nearly nonexistent and ultimately i couldn't find any help in getting this connected.  the only driver i found online was for windows vista.  i will have to return this product, which is highly inconvenient as it came through a different vendor than amazon.  very frustrating purchase.
13	0	1	this is a great value if your looking for a bigger widescreen monitor that will not break your bank. i paid over $100 more than this a year ago for a comparable samsung model. this is a great value for all you websurfers and basic computing needs, resolution is good for some minor picture editing and light video editing. i can recommend this monitor to you with no hesitation.
14	0	1	the acer x193wb - lcd monitor is an excellent monitor for  routine pc use.  the installation on either mac or pc was simple and straight forward.  factory settings is good for most circumstances.  there are a number of special propose settings as well as manual setting to suite individual requirement.  i could not find any thing wrong with this monitor after 10 days of use.
15	0	1	this is my first flat screen monitor and i am truly pleased with this acer.  after much research for one in my price range, the good reviews were true to form. it took me awhile to get use to the large screen, after years of using the old crt's, but just love it now.  the colors are vibrant and i like the option of larger print.  now i have so much more room on my desk; and you just can't beat the price.  very glad i bought this monitor.
16	0	1	i checked all over for a screen that would work and not be too expensive. thanks to the reviews in amazon, i felt safe to buy this one - not knowing much about the product name. i was pleasantly surprised at how nice the display was and it is exactly what i wanted- and for a good price. and as usual, delivery was fast and everything arrived in good shape
17	0	1	i was very pleased with the purchase of the widescreen computer monitor. it was exactly what i wanted and was priced within the range i wanted to pay. the purchase through amozon.com was simple and efficient. i couldn't have asked for anything better.
18	0	1	this one has vga input only.  i have the x193w+bd that has both vga and dvi.  the x193w+bd also has 1680x1050 resolution that can't be beat in a 19" widescreen.  this x193wb is 1440x900 max.  i paid only $20 more with free shipping.  either way, the acer lcd is a very good product.  i have an older al1912 std screen that is 5+ yrs old and still works and looks like new.  the power consumption of the new acer lcds also seemed to be at the low end compared to other products.
19	0	1	i needed a good, inexpensive monitor to replace one that was too small. the acer x193w has met that need. it fits comfortably on my desk and provides a view that reduces the amount of scrolling i need to do when compared with my old monitor. i actually had to turn down the brightness and contrast from factory settings.  my only concern is that the on/off switch is sometimes a little hard to actuate. however, it has not failed - just a little hard to press sometimes due to its recessed position under the bottom edge of the monitor.  given the choice, i would purchase this monitor again.
20	0	1	nice contrast and color.  i was impressed for the price paid.  i did not expect it to have the clarity of a $350.00 monitor and while it was not as perfect as the more expensive monitors, it is plenty close for me.  i am impressed.
21	0	1	wonderful product.  was my son's christmas present, he was very pleased.  quick delivery from tigerdirect.  thank you.
22	0	1	this gateway monitor is really eye catching. i've owned it about 2 weeks as of this review and overall have been pretty happy with it. i returned an hp w2408h that i had purchased prior and found that this monitor had a picture that i preferred over the hp's.  the fhd2401(and the hpw2408h) use a tn panel which is the cause of most of the issues you've seen in these other reviews. it's verticle viewing angle dependent and is a tad darker towards the top although not to the extent of the hp. it also suffers from backlight bleeding on all sides. lastly, the stand doesn't allow much in the way of adjustment.  now, having said all of that...i really like this monitor. the touch sensative controls are easy to use and the picture is nice and crisp. color saturation is all you could ever want and more for a home or gaming monitor due to the wide color gamut and the acrylic, contrast enhancing coating on the screen itself. it's an absolute joy to game on or view the family photo album.  due to the color saturation of the overall image, i wouldn't recommend it for professionals who are looking for color accuracy... if you need that then spend a little more on an s-pva or s-ips panel. i also wouldn't recommend it if you like screens with the matte finish... the reflection might drive you crazy if you work in room with a lot of lights behind you.  overall it's a great consumer level monitor.
23	0	1	i purchased the gateway fhd2400 24-inch widescreen lcd monitor almost a year ago and have enjoyed it without any issues. i don't know the difference between this model and the fhd2401, but i wouldn't imagine that they are significantly different. i work as a software engineer, so i spend upwards of 10+ hours at a time staring at its screen with no eye fatigue to speak of... the screen's brightness takes some getting use to if you are upgrading from an older crt-based monitor as i was. at 24 inches, text and graphics are always easy to see when the display resolution is set to match the native 1920x1200 screen resolution. setting the display resolution to a smaller resolution, e.g. 1600x1200, invites the display to interpolate to match the native format, which makes characters and graphics appear a little fuzzy. if your graphics card can't produce 1920x1200 @ 60 hz, you probably want to upgrade it before purchasing this or any lcd monitor with a native 1920x1200 screen resolution. the screen is highly reflective, but my office has no direct lights that shine on the monitor surface, which would probably be annoying. actually, the monitor's reflective screen makes for a decent mirror, which i use to make sure i don't have any food stuck in my teeth after lunch :-) the picture-in-picture feature is especially useful in my work. you can modify the pip size and position, but only using a set range that often falls short of how i would prefer to adjust the pip, but i guess it's no big deal. the touch controls along the size of the monitor are pretty neat, generating an on-screen menu. however, interacting with this touch menu could be a bit more responsive.
24	0	1	just got this monitor and so far i'm very impressed. as a software professional, i'm going to be looking at it for hours and hours a day, so it has to be very good.  i originally bought the hp w2408h, having had good experience previously with hp monitors, but it was awful. horrible light leakage and inexcusably uneven light distribution. looking at it straight on there were huge gradients of red sweeping across from the left and right sides, such that only the very center was truly accurate.  there was also ghosting of black text on white (yes, using a digital connection). i checked other units and they were the same, so it's a design flaw and not an exception.  i've stayed away from gateway for a long as i can remember, equating their goofy computers with emachines and the like. so i was very skeptical when this one was recommend to me. but i must say that i am very happily surprised.  no dead pixels, which is absolutely critical. moreover, lighting is remarkably even, colors are rich and accurate, and whites are very white. there appears to be extremely minute ghosting around dark text on white, but it is barely perceptible and not nearly as bad as the hp. probably unnoticeable to all but the most obsessively scrutinizing eye.  the dvi-hdmi-vga input combo is impressive as well.  the stand leaves something to be desired, but it's hardly a deal beaker. screen is bright and sharp, which is what counts most. didn't even realize it had pip until i set it up. neat feature, but really only for folks who intend to use it as a tv (and why would you waste a crystal clear 1920x1200 monitor as a tv?).  no usb ports or speakers, but again who really needs these on a monitor? if you just want a great monitor, i recommend this.
25	0	1	i liked the look of this monitor in the store, although i wasn't too sure about the glossy finish.  i was hooked on the picture-in-picture though. unfortunately i wasn't thorough enough before buying, and the monitor has color issues, when it is on my desk my eyes are level with a point about 1/4 the way from the bottom of the screen and about 2 feet away.  from there i see a definite color change in the top 3 inches of the screen, and on some games the detail there just vanishes into darkness.  if i stand up over the monitor it seems much better and more uniform, but seated it just doesn't look right.  i think i'll try to take this back and get a dell...
26	0	1	had read a lot of great reviews of the gateway 2400 24 inch monitor. mistakenly thought this was a newer version of that monitor that would be even better.  this monitor has a glossy and reflective screen. some may like this aspect but i personally prefer the matte finish of monitors.  the colors and brightness on the monitor change depending on the location of the graphics on the display. for example, if you are looking at the monitor from a fixed position at your desk then the image at the top of the screen looks quite a bit different from the image at the bottom of the screen.  i returned the monitor after less than one hour of use.
27	0	1	i have powerful workstations at home and at work. but i just started an online graduate program, and wanted something very light, stylish, and functional upon which to do my schoolwork, check email, and do online research. this baby is perfect for me. after three weeks, i am pleased with battery life (i get more than three hours on my 3-cell), connectivity, ease of use, quality, etc. it is so sleek, small and light, i am delighted. i appreciate having xp, and am impressed. i paid $349 at best buy, and feel it was $$ well-spent. heck, the next one i get (2 years down the line?) will probably be $100 and 10 times as powerful. not the best product for your only computer, but for a road warrior or student on the go, this baby is a delight.
28	0	1	i really like the design. the keyboard was very nice and easy to type on unlike the asus eee pc which was really small and i have fairly small hands too. if i have to nitpick, the backspace key was not full size, but i can live with that. about the fan noise, i didn't hear the fan buzzing noise that people are complaining about.  in the end, however, i returned the laptop because it had a crack right below touch pad. i opted to get a msi wind instead. acer would have made a perfect mini laptop if they had included the 6-cell battery from the beginning. the 3-cell battery life was a disappointment. even though acer is coming out with the 6-cell battery option at the end of september, the battery is not flushed like the msi wind or asus eee pc. it protrudes out the back instead of down, which looks horrible in my opinion, destroying the nice elegant look of the laptop.  in the end, if you are concern about price and battery life, wait for the 6-cell version of the acer one. it is the best value in my opinion in terms of price and features. but if you also care about the look and feel of the laptop with the 6-cell battery like i do, go with the msi wind or asus 1000h, plus one extra inch (10") make a big difference on these mini laptops.
29	0	1	lovely netbook, but the wireless radio was inoperative, and yes, i had the wireless switch turned on.  so, i returned it.  i have a dell inspiron mini 9 with ubuntu linux on order.  expected ship date 10/10/2008.  thanks, amazon, for accepting the return of the acer.  by the way, brother in law in france ordered an acer aspire one with a french keyboard. he got same, but it worked as if it were an american (qwerty) keyboard.  when he wrote to acer support for help, they said that they could not help him, and that it was the fault of the french distributor for not checking the computers first before selling them.  shame, acer, if that is the best you can do for support.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/acer-aspire-one-8-9-inch-mini-laptop-1-6-ghz-intel-atom-n270-processor-512-mb-ram-8-gb-solid-state-drive-linpus-linux-lite-white/dp/b001bbs76q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">acer aspire one 8.9-inch mini laptop (1.6 ghz intel atom n270 processor, 512 mb ram, 8 gb solid state drive, linpus linux lite) white</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/acer-aspire-one-8-9-inch-mini-laptop-1-6-ghz-intel-atom-n270-processor-512-mb-ram-8-gb-solid-state-drive-linpus-linux-lite-white/dp/b001bbs76q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">acer aspire one 8.9-inch mini laptop (1.6 ghz intel atom n270 processor, 512 mb ram, 8 gb solid state drive, linpus linux lite) white</a>
30	0	1	the last two reviews kill me. one guy says "with the case it has, i think they could easily have given you 10" of screen, instead of 8.9". none of them is too bad for the road." the entire purpose of this is to be as small as possible, not big, jesus, you'd think the idiot would realize in the actual product name...ultraportable.  yet another guy wrote, "the wireless connected easily with my home network. i found that it initially ran very slowly when the unit was using the battery but this was easily corrected by setting the 'power save mode' on the device's advanced tab to 'normal'. ". well of course it ran slowly in power save mode. it is supposed to! and of course when you put the power mode on normal it will run...normal duh!  and yet again let me quote, "still, i worry about the hard drive. once, i was putting the machine into hibernation and it accidentally got bumped. it took a real long time to finish the hibernation process and when i attempted to restart the machine it gave me an error message saying there was 'no boot disk' available." of course if you bump an ultraportable you stand the chance of doing damage to the hdd. are these people actually allowed to use a computer? i own a computer company and have used this laptop and it works exactly as expected from a 9" ultraportable. if you want small and reliable, look no further.
31	0	1	i suppose i should state at the onset of this review that i am a hopeless computer junkie. with the purchase of the aspire one i now have four notebook computers and two desktop units (in my defense one of the notebooks is owned by my employer). to give you an idea of what i consider fun, i converted an ibm thinkpad x41 to use a solid state disk drive. so i like to tinker with computers.  i got the aspire one to monitor my personal email account at work. my employer has been setting up more and more stringent firewalls to the point where i couldn't access my email from the it network. they *do* provide a 'guest' network, however, and it is through this that the aspire will communicate with the outside world.  so what do i think of it?  pros: - the machine is very well built. the fit and finish is very nice. - the keyboard is very usable - i found i could touch type on it with only a little adjustment. all the keys are where they should be, with nothing out of place (see where they put the right hand shift key on the eee pc, for example). - the wireless connected easily with my home network. i found that it initially ran very slowly when the unit was using the battery but this was easily corrected by setting the 'power save mode' on the device's advanced tab to 'normal'. - the screen is sharp and bright, but does have a reflective surface that some might not like. - it runs windows xp and has lots of room for applications and data - the webcam is fun - i installed skype and had a blast making video calls to my family.  cons: - the fan is noisy and runs continuously. this would have been a deal-killer had i not located a fan control utility on aspireoneuser.com. with this utility running the fan only comes on when you are running processor intensive applications. and the cpu does not get overly hot. i highly recommend it. - the trackpad is poorly laid out. the left and right buttons are in the wrong spot and make selecting and clicking a two-handed operation. it helps to use the 'tap' feature but there are still times when you have to use both hands. i chalk this up to one of the trade offs the designers had to make to keep the machine small. - the 3-cell battery can only power the machine for ~2.5 hours, and that is with the screen on half-intensity. i am already considering getting a 6-cell battery from 'santa' at christmas. reports indicate that it will give you more than 5 hours of endurance which would be nice to have. the downside is the price - it lists for $120. that's a lot to shell out when the whole machine costs only $350, but i figure if it is a gift it won't count. ;-). i've heard that acer is releasing a model with the 6-cell battery and 160gb hard driver for only $400. if you can wait this might be the way to go. - i worry about the long term stability of the hard drive. when i first turned the machine on and set up windows i tried putting it into 'standby' mode. i found that i couldn't get it out of standby no matter what i tried. in desperation i powered the machine down (a no-no with windows) and restarted it.  on restart, windows ran chkdsk and found scores of bad pointers and orphaned files! when the desktop appeared i found that i could no longer configure power management, volume or networking. when i attempted to use the acer system restore function that too was inoperable, complaining that a .dll file was missing or corrupted. i found that acer would send me a system recovery disk for $30 but then i would still have to get an external usb optical drive to use it. i was not pleased.  but like i said, i like to tinker. with a little time and effort i was able to download the corrupted .dll file and get the hard drive restored to its factory default image. i regained access to all the missing applications and i have not had any further issues with standby.  still, i worry about the hard drive. once, i was putting the machine into hibernation and it accidentally got bumped. it took a real long time to finish the hibernation process and when i attempted to restart the machine it gave me an error message saying there was 'no boot disk' available. powering the unit off and rebooting 'solved' the problem and i ran a utility to examine the health of the drive that found no issues. still, i think acer should develop a hd protection system similar to what ibm has for its thinkpad models. the one is so light and portable that it is inevitable that it will get bumped around. of course, you could also get the linux model with the solid state hard drive but then you sacrifice all that disk capacity.  in conclusion, i like the aspire one and feel it will fulfill its mission. for the money, it is a very good deal.
32	0	1	the first thing that you have to know about this computer is that is an ultra portable, this means, it was designed to be easy to carry around.  i bought it as a second laptop, for those times where i have to travel, and so far i am loving it. i am a guy with big hands, and average to thick fingers, and other ultra portables (eee and lifebook, to name a few) made impossible for me to type a sentence, even less an email. the keyboard in this computer is still a bit small, but i have typed comfortably relatively long emails (thousand words or so). i wouldn't recommend it as a main laptop, but in the road is small, light, is perfect.  the bad things: the speakers don't give good sound, as they are in the bottom of the machine. the top is a fingerprint magnet, this is, if you don't keep it into the cover that comes with it, you will see notorious fingerprints all over it rather fast. with the case it has, i think they could easily have given you 10" of screen, instead of 8.9". none of them is too bad for the road.
33	0	1	compre la mini acer aspire one exelente equipo portatil, facil de transportar, viene con mouse incorporado y uno adicional para coneccion usb, trae instalado el office 2007 version de prueba de 60 dias y antivirus, exelente equipo para quienes viajan constantemente lo recomiendo muy rapida, juan campos, venezuela
34	0	1	too bad, mine was doa - would not boot.  acer sent me disks to reinstall windows (after a 2 week wait - out of stock),  but the unit does not have a dvd drive, so the files must be copied to a usb drive so the computer can boot from that.  i thought my 2 gig drive would do, so you actually needed a 4 gig drive, which i didn't have.  acer acknowledged that there had been a batch of these shipped with corrupted windows.  amazon was great and refunded the money.
35	0	1	this little computer is amazing. i'm a computer tech and got it to test wireless systems. it's so much lighter and smaller than my other notebook i can carry it up ladders and hold it up there. it has more flexibility in how much you can tilt the screen back than some other tiny notebooks so it's easy to read, although the small screen isn't ideal for old eyes without reading glasses.  i don't hear the fan noise everybody is talking about, and i'm getting about 3 hours on the smaller battery.  my understanding is that while the 6 cell battery will give you more time, it will make the unit a bit heavier.  if you are captain kangaroo this computer will fit in your pocket no problem.  for the rest of us it's about the size of a clutch purse, and will drop into your briefcase with no problems -- perfect for plane travel.  if running time on battery is important to you, the newer unit with the 6 cell battery might be a better choice as the battery a lone will cost more than the difference in price.  the screen is bright and clear, though reflections might be a problem, and the keyboard is small but usable, with its slightly oversized enter, backspace and shift keys.  overall, it would be hard to find a notebook computer for the price with all the features this one has.  if you can live with the smaller screen and shrunken keyboard it's an ideal travel computer and a great addition to your desktop.  it is not a desktop replacement unless you are a maschocist.  another plus is the roomy hard drive.  plenty to hold music and photos, unlike the other mini notebooks that use ram.  finally, it does come with a slip case that offers minimal protection but no storage for the ac adapter, which, by the way, is much smaller than other notebooks.
36	0	1	so handy and compact - fast enough for my apps. it's easy to read up close. we have 2 other laptops and all my kids have their own. it's the best for internet, would be fine for  simpler tasks, probably not games, serious word processing, etc.  mine is 1 gig/ 120g hd.  i got it delivered for $339.  they should get cheaper or more advanced for same bucks.  oh yes, speakers aren't much, as you might expect - low quality audio on built ins.
37	0	1	after reading the reviews on wal mart and amazon's websites, i decided to take a chance on this little beast (white, xp). when i first started it up, it ran like a charm, but i quickly discovered that upon putting the computer into hibernate or standby modes, it would lose its wifi connections. and i mean lose. i couldn't turn on the wifi and the computer didn't even know it was there. i had to turn it off and restart it to get it to show up again. i googled the problem, and apparently i wasn't the only one with the issue. i read all kinds of threads about people having the exact same problem. i tried downloading drivers and changing settings, but nothing worked. when i was about to give up, i downloaded all of the windows updates for the machine, including the optional ones, and from that point on, it has worked like a charm. all of the positive reviews about everything else on here have been pretty accurate. once you get the wifi working (something that's very important in my line of work) this little computer is amazing. it packs a lot of bang for its buck, and has been worth the initial 12 hours of frustration. just make sure the first thing you do is download those updates! if i have any more problems, i'll update the review. but so far, so good. update: still having wifi issues when i put the machine into hibernate. if i wait a while after putting it into hibernate the wifi is still there when it restarts, but if i restart it soon after hibernate, no wifi. the machine runs pretty hot, especially when streaming content from the internet, so i think it may be an issue about the installed wireless card getting too hot and needing some cooldown time. just a theory - i'm no computer expert. i'm leaving the score at four stars because - although it gets kind of hot and there is a loud fan (not too loud as to be a big deal for me)- the computer still functions very smoothly and does everything i need it to do quite well. hopefully the heat it generates won't effect the hardware, but it hasn't been an issue so far.
38	0	1	great laptop, only complaint is that battery won't las too long, but you have the option to buy an extra long lasting one to solve this issue, overall since i bought it, just wonderful.
39	0	1	so far i am just loving my acer.  it is handy to take no matter where i go.  i am using it for word processing, and internet.  i have wanted a netbook for what seemed like a long time.  i am happy with my purchase.
40	0	1	light weight good for travel... but net is slow when running on battery. i tried all the settings but couldn't figure out how to correct that.
41	0	1	i bought my acer aspire one about a month ago and i couldn't be more pleased.  a lot of people complain about the small keyboard, but i got used to mine after about 5 minutes. i can type just as well on it as i can on a normal full-size keyboard. just for record, i have pretty big hands compared to the average.  the machine boots up quick (around 15 seconds). i haven't bogged down the resources by installing a bunch of unneccessary software, so it probably helps to keep the hard drive clean and uncluttered.  i can't comment on the battery life too much since i usually use mine while its plugged-in. the ac adapter is so small and it's not bulky at all, so it's easy enough to simply carry it with me when i leave the house with the laptop.  my major complaint is also a very trivial one: the top of the lid shows tons of obvious fingerprints/smudges. it's a cosmetic issue, but i'm curious as to how acer could have overlooked such a blaring mistake in their design of the laptop. i also wouldn't rely upon the webcam for good quality pictures..  the fan noise is not loud, especially compared to a desktop. there's a small whirring noise, but it's not obtrusive. i can easily fall asleep with my laptop running on my nightstand and not be bothered by it at all. the bottom of the laptop does get warm after awhile of use, but that's to be expected.  overall, i am extremely pleased with my purchase. if you need a computer to watch videos and surf the web, this is your machine!  pro tip: if you can't find a small laptop case to store your aspire in, then try using a portable dvd player case. i'm using mine and it's perfect!
42	0	1	i bought this second netbook after buying an acer aspire one about a month earlier. these are perfect little computers for their portability while having the ability to run office 2007 products. i wouldn't recommend someone buying one of these as a primary laptop for business use because the screen is limiting. as a second laptop to carry lots of information around, these little netbooks are perfect. i have not had any problems with either one of these netbooks.
43	0	1	my wife and i both got aspire ones after falling in love with them at wal mart.  unfortunately, mine barely lasted a month.  i went to fire mine up one day and the screen was fried, apparently the aspire one's lcd panel had become cracked and/or damaged.  this is my sixth laptop that i have had, either for home or work.  this laptop was treated with much more care than any of the other five, all of which never had an lcd problem.  in examining the unit, it appears that there is a gap near the hinges where the screen does not sit flush with the keyboard when closed.  i'm not sure what caused the damage, but my guess is that acer used an lcd that is much too thin.  i have found other people on line who have acer aspire ones with cracked screens that had not mistreated the units.  the irritating thing about this is that the acer aspire one is advertised as a "perfect kid's computer" and something you can just toss in a backpack or carry with you.  it does not seem unreasonable to expect that the unit be at least as durable as a full sized notebook.  unfortunately, if my unit is any indication it is not.  and acer has said the problem described is most likely my fault.  of course, acer does not offer accidental damage protection on this computer, so maybe they know there is a problem.  the tech said that i could ship it in for review.  if it is deemed damaged by me, a new screen will be $199.  that's over half what i paid for the unit.  way to go acer.
44	0	1	my purchase is a nice experience. my tiny computer is complete in equipment and essencial systems; it is shipped to me within the ordered time; it looks good; it is convenient to carry; i derive great enjoyment from using it.
45	0	1	very nice,well made,speedy processor,excellent 1gb ram amazing 160 gb hard drive..would recommend the 6 cell battery as this one only gets 2 hrs
46	0	1	... i bought this for my five year old daughter who is an electronics fan and wanted her own computer badly (after tired of asking me to use my laptop). i found this item perfect in size & price. couldn't be more glad of my decision after my daughter got into it ... great practical product for everyone ... !!!
47	0	1	a great little notebook,real handy no regrets on buying, it look forward to a lot of use out of it. had trouble with the battery was replaced with no trouble. the instruction manual left me a bit up in the air, but every thing worked out. would buy another of there products
48	0	1	acer apire one is a very well-designed netbook, it is very light and does everything it's suppose to do. it's big enough to work comfortably,  it  does not take much space and it is easy to carry everywhere. it's the best money can buy for that price.
49	0	1	a great performer.  it's light and it's fast.  and, what a price!  the keyboard is a little small, but it's still easy to use.  i don't think anybody would be making a mistake by buying this.
50	0	1	absolutely fabulous from the moment the box was opened. even had a nice sleeve for it that ws never mentioned. i followed the bologs and took the bloat off. speedy!
51	0	1	first off, let me start by saying that i've owned many notebooks over the past 12 years and use them a lot for work and personal use.  this is one great little computer & the price is downright astonishing. computers this size are commonly referred to as a "netbook", but unlike some of the other netbooks, the aspire one's capabilities are on par with a full-fledged notebook.  first of all, there's the specs... a zippy 1.6 ghz intel atom processor with 1gb ram is plenty quick enough to perform everyday tasks. even somewhat resource-hungry apps like photoshop 7 operate without a hitch.  you won't be able to run the biggest, baddest games on it, but for the majority of applications, it's up to the task. a spacious 120 gb hard drive gives you plenty of room for software and other files.  the screen is terrific. bright, super-sharp, and easy to read. one of the sharpest notebook screens i've seen.  the keys are 95% the size of a standard keyboard with a great tactile feel, so typing is surprisingly easy. pretty much like any other notebook keyboard.  the build quality also seems excellent. a common failure point on notebooks are the screen hinges. on this one, they appear far more robust than the hinges on even larger notebooks, and seem very unlikely to break. overall fit and finish are excellent. everything feels tight, and all parts meet flush with each other. a very well-made product.  one way acer has kept the size down is by eschewing a built-in cd or dvd drive. but that's not a problem. you can easily connect an external drive to one of the 3 usb ports, and burn cds or dvds, or watch movies.  another cool feature is that the aspire one supports 2 monitors simultaneously. you can hook an external monitor or even a big screen tv up via the vga port to watch movies or do presentations. the built-in multi card reader is a handy touch too.  some others have complained about the small size of the touchpad and the location of the mouse buttons, but it's posed no problem for me.  the only very minor caveats i can think of with this notebook is that though the finish is gorgeous, it also shows every finger smudge because of it's high gloss. ditto for the screen  while i wouldn't recommend it as a main computer because of it's diminutive size, it's the ultimate solution for anyone looking for an ultra-portable but full-featured notebook.
52	0	1	first, let me congratulate acer on how close they came to succeeding with this thing.  it's light as a feather, it's portable  -  about a third of the size of my main laptop  -  the battery life is decent, and the hard drive is expansive.  that it can do so well without a dvd drive is a testament to how far flash and external drives have come (and how cheap memory has gotten) in the past few years.  the wireless function is reliable, the screen sharp, the user interface compact, and the casing durable.  it's very reasonably priced; it comes with a webcam.  and i even like the color.  too bad, then, about its two fatal flaws.  1) it is slow as heck.  i'm not trying to play "crysis" here.  *loading webpages* is often too much for the aspire one.  it took over two minutes to load a product page, for example, and i can feel it overheating from the effort as i type.  that's unacceptable for any computer in the modern market.  it's not a program issue  -  i have nothing but explorer running  -  though it means you're going to have to manage your programs very closely.  (if your aspire came preloaded with mcafee, for example, then you're gonna have to dump it for something less obtrusive like avg, or else you'll never get your processor unfrozen.)  sure, i can take the aspire anywhere  -  but if it takes a glacial epoch to check my e-mail, what's the point?  2) the following should rank as no more than an annoyance, but it's so pervasive that it's become a major turn-off.  the "shrink/enlarge text" function in explorer has been oddly mapped to the trackpad and left-click, so that when you attempt to scroll a webpage up or down, you'll often end up screwing up the font size.  it's frustrating to have to stop and adjust explorer to get your pages back to legibility thirty times a session.  yeah, it's just one bug in one program  -  like a pull to the left in the steering wheel is just one malfunction in one part of the car.  it's comparatively small, you can compensate for it, but it seriously hampers a main function of the machine, and there's no way it should have gotten past quality control.  they'll eventually succeed with the aspire, even if only through the inexorable progress of moore's law, but in its current state, it's just not practical.  i won't be keeping mine, but i look forward to the day when acer gets it right.
53	0	1	coming from a guy who has everything this thing is perfect.  i am a techie.  i have a little bit of everything.  for years i have carried around the biggest laptop bookbags i can so i can keep my laptop and whatever i may need with me.  this great little thing will make sure i can remove a good 8lbs or so from my load. this little laptop does everything you need in a small light package.  i have read many reviews where people complain about the fan noise.  i have had my netbook since christmas eve and has not heard the fan once.  it also only took me about 20 minutes to get use to the slightly smaller keyboard. my version came with the 3cell battery and i have seen a 9cell for sale.  i promise that will be my first purchase before the new year.  while it may be bigger and stick out from the laptop as oposed to the 3cell.  with the 11+ hour battery life that means i can make it through an entire days use and not need to break out my power cord or even carry it.  for anybody considering picking up 1 of these as a 2nd, more portable option to your current solution there should be no question here.  just make sure you buy more than 1 because someone close to you is going to be jealous you didn't get them 1 too.
54	0	1	i got my boyfriend this little laptop for his christmas gift. to our surprise, the battery came from the factory with a full charge so he could start using it right away! he can't put it down! we'd been wanting a small laptop to take on our trips - for journaling and downloading the many photos we both take. we didn't want to pay the $1800+ for the small sony, so we've gone without. this laptop is the perfect solution! we can't believe it's capabilities! web browsing is surprising fast, much faster than our existing vaio laptops. this is a perfect companion for anyone that travels or likes to surf the internet. and at only 2 pounds, he'll be able to take it anywhere! it's the size of a book yet the keyboard is almost full size. amazing! with all the usb ports, i'm sure we'll find lots more uses for it that we haven't even thought of yet! what a little gem!
55	0	1	this is a very well-designed netbook, which does everything it's suppose to do. first of all, it is very light, which makes this device very mobile. for its size, the keyboard works surprisingly well. only thing i don't like about is the split mouse button, which takes some time to get used to.  even after i got used to it, i'd still prefer normal mouse buttons. other than that, the keyboard and touch pad works like a charm. i've watch netflix, hulu, and youtube videos without any problem. i even managed to watch hd trailers on yahoo movie without any problem. it is true the intel atom processor is lacking certain "oopms" the duel cores offer.  and that's the reason why i said this netbook is not a replacement computer.  you'll notice it takes little longer for certain programs to execute than your typical deskptop/laptop but it's not something you should to too concerned about. like most netbooks, this does not have any optical drives. (no dvd player) screen is beautiful and very crisp. battery life isn't something i can brag about since it lasts me about 2 hours with my 3 cell battery. i can order a 6 cell battery but i don't like the fact that battery will stick out from back of the computer but if you are looking for longer battery life, just know that there is an option. fan is bit loud. audio is decent.  sometime it sounds too "echo-y" when i crank up the volume but it's much better than my samsung q1up speakers since you can actually hear the sound. webcam works beautifully. i've tested skype and it works very smoothly with high video/audio quality. you can upgrade the memory to 2gb but it's not something you can simply open up a slot and install. i wouldn't recommend doing it unless you have some experience with opening up your computer completely because you seriously need to pull apart almost the whole computer just to install 1 extra gb of memory. i can't think of anything else to talk about. the reason i gave it 5 stars, even with few kinks here and there, is because of the netbook's capabilities with such a low price. i highly recommend this netbook for students for its mobility and price.
56	0	1	i purchased this computer after our dell broke down.  the price is awesome only 350.00 compared to twice that for a full=size laptop.  i read amazon reviews prior to purchase to be sure i made the right decision, and i am very pleased with my purchase. i have only had my aspire one for a few days but already love it.  the size is awesome, i can take it anywhere, it is so small you can carry right with your books.  the size is also great for those small desks in some college classrooms. it does not like to have multiple windows open at the same time.  i have froze up several times when i was running office and explorer, but i can live with that. i was pleased that it came with works and office trial.  i took this to my college classes on the last day, everyone loved it!  one thought it was adorable and looked like a computer had a baby.  this would be awesome for students.
57	0	1	****update*** i'm still using this little machine. and still love my netbook. i had to wipe it clean when it caught a virus on windows, and  replaced the os with linux---twice. and i had to replace the keyboard--when puppy sitting a corgi, make sure the computer is put away, and not near fluids. i still love the portability and the size, and still think it was one of my best purchases.  after thinking about this for awhile, and nearly salivating looking at them, i finally bought one. i download e-books, and my lappie just wasn't conducive to relaxing with a good book----ironic because that's why i went to a laptop from a desktop. i had looked at the sony e-reader, and yes the kindle. neither are much smaller than this, and not much of a price difference. this however can access the internet without extra cost and is portable. no dvd/cd player,for me that's ok,i rarely use it anyway. if i think i'd like one, i'll buy an external unit. so far i love it. i'm not techy---at all---and the set up was a snap, it basically did it itself, once set up i connected it to my wireless, again very easy, and i was ready to start playing. i don't really notice the fan others have. the keyboard is smaller, but this is a mini-laptop, what would you expect? i don't really find this an issue. i bet it's a challenge for those with bigger hands and fingers. i see from one of the previous reviewers that i can get a 6-cell battery for it-will this improve performance on battery?-it is rather slow running just on battery, and ram can be added to for vista, i'll be in touch with you-:).  my concern at this point is that my bigger laptop may end up neglected in favor of this one.  i would definitely recommend this item, and acer in general. both my lappies are acer and i've been very satisfied.
58	0	1	after a month use this computer just stop working all i can hear is the fan when i turn on the computer on. although this is my second acer aspire one i'm happy with the white aspire one 3-cell linux os.
59	0	1	i love this little guy!!! it's very portable and works like a charm. looks like xp, feels like xp ... guess what? it is xp!! i will be doing some travelling and can't wait to take it on the road with me. it's tiny but the keyboard feels like a "normal" keyboard. the screen is sharp and clear and the battery life(6 cell) is excellent!! wireless works great too!! plenty of space with the 160g hd. wow!! did i mention ... i love this little guy!!!
60	0	1	the acer aspire 8.9 inch laptop is one great little machine. i have operated it for 3 months. i have taken it all over europe and have had no problems with connecting to any internet server. i especially like the multi voltage battery charger that comes with the computer. all you need is plug adapter. after caring around a e machines 15.4" that weighs in with charger and voltage adapter 11 pounds this is a dream. i have found that the speed of the machine is a little slower then the the big one but is not a deal dropper. screen graphics are great. the mouse is a little too sensitive for my heavy fingers but again not a deal breaker. i use the machine for emails and photo storage, the memory is fantastic. i used an external cd drive to down load programs i need for work and it works great.  over all this is one huge bang for the bucks. can't beat for size, weight, memory and price
61	0	1	i am very satisfied with this mini laptop.  it is very appropriate for those who travel a lot.
62	0	1	i've had my aspire for just over a month now and i couldn't be happier with it.  it's just what i need -- i started grad school in the fall and i needed something to help get things done while i was in my office.  this has done the trick!  it's so small that i can take it anywhere, including class.  it has great battery life, so that hasn't been a concern either.  this was absolutely a fantastic purchase and i would do it again in a heartbeat.
63	0	1	my wife was looking for a small laptop to take with her on business trips. i found this one, read the reviews and decided to get it.  here's my take:  the screen is not too small.  i bought it because it was small. some complain that the fan is loud. i haven't heard the fan. my daughter will be getting one for christmas and several people at my wifes work are considering getting one.  i think its an excellent "alternate" computer.
64	0	1	i bought this for my teenage daughter for her birthday but of course i had to check it out myself.  the clarity of the video is nice for being such a small screen.  the feel of the keyboard was actually pretty decent.  i do recommend getting an external mouse but only because i despise touch pads. it connected to my wireless router easily and i tested it at food court and it pulled up a connection with little to no difficulty. i connected it to an external dvd r/w and even though it didn't have the drivers for it it still worked.  the internet connection was pretty decent wireless and wired. it charged up quickly and the battery lasted as advertised (i was impressed too!) overall i give it a (4 out of 5) just because there is always room for improvement.  but i do give it a personal rating of (5 out of 5) because it has everything you need, to do what you need to do and move on, with out the hassle or extra cost of carrying an extra bag to put it in.
65	0	1	i have had my one for about a week. i had been looking at the eee pc since last jan. i'm glad i waited. the one is a great little computer. i got the one with xp since i am used to windows. it has a 120gb hard drive so i don't have to worry about storage space. i will have to be careful because this one has moving parts. i had read other reviews state that they had trouble with the wireless networking. i have not experienced this or had the fan make a lot of noise. the keyboard size is just fine for me and i'm a big guy but i don't touch type anyway. if you are looking for a umpc this is a great one ( no pun intended). this is now my favorite computer. i decided i could live with the 3 cell battery. it is a little on the slow side but not exceptionally slow and i don't like waiting. the one does all i need to do on a routine basis although it's good to have a nore conventional system on call. i turned off my desktop. the one does not have a cd drive but i already had a usb cd drive. but sd cards can be used to transfer data if need be. this little guy is so good my wife wants one and she is not into tech stuff at all. try one you'll love it (pun intended).
66	0	1	this is a great little notebook computer for those whom are always on the go. i did purchase the one that had windows xp installed, but not being a big windows fan, i did away with it and installed ubuntu linux operating system on it. it works fantastic and i am very happy with this purchase. since it is about the same size as a hardback book, it will fit nicely in a ladies purse, or even in a man's long coat/trench coat pocket. it is very lite and easy to handle. and beats carrying around a larger notebook computer when you are running around all day. the battery has about a 2 hour charge, so if you are going to use it a lot away from home, make sure you have your charger handy!
67	0	1	i've only had this laptop for a few days and i love it. i'm on the road a lot and didn't want a big laptop and this was exactly what i needed. office depot had a sale and i was able to pick it up for $319.00 + tax. i was curious if it would be compatible with the new usb broadband air cards(dongles),so i hooked up a sierra wireless compass 597 model from sprint and voila!, 3g speed baby! sweet!!
68	0	1	when i tried to worked on this little guy....i thought wow...the lcd strikes you as crisp and bright. the webcam built into the unit is likewise very surprising in quality.... it is really bright and sharp....blowing the likes of apple's latest 13" macbook. webcam quality pretty much rivals that of logitech.  when you boot it up the unit really opens up pretty fast and much to my surprise the unit is really very quick. i have a toshiba 12.1" dual core and yet it feels like this is faster indeed......the battery fully charged only lasts about an hour....it's a little light and i was expecting really more computing time. an extra battery at >$100 is a turn off though....  overall i am very happy and satisfied with the unit....it's going to be my travel companion from now on!! at 2lbs....you bet this will be a world traveler.
69	0	1	charger defective - would not operate on ac power nor charge battery.  returned to walmart for prompt refund, but will probably try another of this same model (local store was out or otherwise i would have already gambled on another).  initial setup took a good 30 minutes, but that's to be expected. i like xp, and the display is fine for what i want - basic interent use - email, facebook, etc., and it's lightweight and compact.  you can easily tote it about with one or two fingers wedged between the screen and keyboard... although they instruct you not to do this.  bought a second unit, which lasted three weeks. sent to acer repair, received it via fedex today - and guess what?  it boots up, then shuts itself down.  acer stated they updated the bios, but they obviously didn't bother to test this before shipping it to me.  i spoke with their tech support and am shipping it back to them, yet again, for repairs.  i spent $348 (+ tax), on something i can't use and can't return, but the worst part is i also signed up for wireless access which is costing me $60/month while my netbook is in the repair shop.
70	0	1	nearly 72 hours, i am still impressed with this little device. at first i was just looking and considering purchasing a toshiba laptop to use for my photographic field work. yet a full sized (15-17 inch) model with all the bells & whistles was just a bit much to carry around (no bones to grind with toshiba. i still want to replace my desktop). however, a couple of clicks and a quick read about the acer aspire one and i was interested. further reading and comparisons, visiting the acer website for a more detailed look, started me on a search for small, functional and inexpensive. believe me, i am picky about what products i purchase. i tend to stick with names that i know. albeit, acer was one of those brand names that i watched climb up the consumers market ladder. to make a long story short, i found myself looking deeper into the acer aspire one and was quite impressed with what i was reading (not only here on amazon, but everywhere else). i am a photographer and wanted a small platform for viewing photos while in the field, but something larger than the 2.5" screen on my nikon. the 8.9" screen on the acer filled the bill. most of my shots are that size when i load them into photoshop. the fact that the aspire one uses the full screen for viewing was a perfect match. believe it, the screen is crystal clear. secondly, the choice of hard drives wasn't a tough factor either. i got the 120gb as i have a portable 250gb for storing photos, but there is a 160gb available in other models. so for me, its a hands down match. clean out the bundled software that you don't need, and keep only the necessary softwares, space is no longer a concern. windows xp sp3 with all of its mighty updates doesn't even begin to use up that much space! so, right out of the box this little machine is everything acer has said it to be. and for me (and the work that i do), it is perfect. i am very impressed with the acer aspire one. first day in the field with me and it provided internet and allowed me to view/edit photos. it made my work that much easier.  pros: - out of box availability   acer was not kidding with this thought and to prove it, the battery   has a 50-78% charge on it. - complete mobility - intuitive interface   usual function keys (f1 - f12) and the blue function keys are very   easy to understand or figure out. however there is an acrobat file   of the user's guide and pressing the fn+f1 keys brings up an help   menu - compact & light-weight   literally no larger than the composition notebook that i used to carry   in school and weighs no more than a 1 liter bottle of pepsi. - uses sd memory cards for extra storage   you don't have to carry that extra portable hd if you don't want to. i   left mine at home for the first field test. not disappointed. just pop   in an 8 or 16gb sd card and go. - included pouch   didn't know that came in the box! nifty little surprise - battery low warning   little battery in the task bar tells you when you need to charge the   battery, and powers down the system to hibernate when it is critical.   so no information is lost. a definite plus. - attractive   acer offers 5 different colors. i got mine in sapphire blue  cons - memory is only 1.5 gb. not enough to complain about, but it does make   one wonder if there will be an update to increase that to 2 gb or   better. - 15 second power up   this may be the way linux works, but windows takes a   few seconds longer. not a real threat to the system though. - no cd/dvd's   unlike a desktop that gives you restoration disks, the unit relies on   a recovery program to restore the unit to factory settings. could be a   pro in this sense, but i am used to having the disks at hand. all-in-all i am impressed with my aspire one. again, i am taking it out into the field today. yep, i am that pleased with it! i will recommend it to my friends who are also looking for small, functional and inexpensive.
71	0	1	i really loved this computer and personally i believe that it is the best thing out there for the price. pros- 1.) it has 120 gb of storage memory. you can load all your videos and music on the go. you can load up word and get all of your office needs on it and if you need to give presentations you can actually do the power point in the computer and present it from there since it has a vga connection. 2.) it is very light, no strain on you back if you need to carry it around. 3.) it connects to wifi almost immediately, the only thing that connects faster is a macbook pro. (i have compared it to several of my friend's computers and my own mac). 4.) it has a built in camera and mic, this is great if you are doing video conferencing or if you are calling mom on the other side of the country. the mic captures voice very clearly and the digital video is really good. 5.) the atom processor is faster that i thought it would be, it is even good enough to do video editing with nero!!! (in order to do this and burn a dvd you would have to have an external dvd writer, which you can get for $35) now, don't get me wrong, the video editing will be slower than with a core duo machine, but it will get the job done. 6.) it is an ingenious idea to get rid of all the internal hardware that you usually don't need on the go, such as a dvd/cd drive. in most cases i only burn dvd/cds at home anyways, so not having to lug the extra weight is nice. 7.) the keyboard is pretty big for an ultra portable devise. the box claims it is 95% the actual size of one. i'll say this, if your hands are average size you will not have a problem with the key board. my good friend is 6.2" and can grab a basket ball with one hand, he said that he hated the keyboard because it was too small. it's good to me though. cons: 1.) if you buy the 3 cell battery model, you will only get 2 hours of video playing/music playing or 2.5 hours of using your productivity software. 2.) if you are going to use this computer as your one and only, then you will need an external dvd/cd writer. (if you have another computer, then all you need to do is transfer the data that you worked on and burn the dvd/cd on the other computer- transfer can occur via usb flash). 3.) the screen is small and if you have problems with your vision you will not like it. my in-laws  did not like this at all. it does not bother me in the least, it all depends on you.  bottom line, if you are on the go and want something of a mix between an ipod(video/audio)/a computer/smart phone (via skype), then this is the machine for you.
72	0	1	okay, i bought this product and once i have received it i haven't put it down. it became a necessity in college and i always have people looking at my computer from curiosity that they even make as small computers as mine. i think i couldn't have made a better choice.
73	0	1	i owned it for a month, and within that month, i had to e-recover it twice. now it wouldn't boot up (dead), dropped it at best buy (another store i wouldn't buy from anymore), it's been 2 1/2 weeks and it is still waiting for parts. the manager terry said i should have bought a $99.00 service. bullcrap!, laptop is a month old, for god's sake. this is one hell of an experience, don't buy this computer, it is a piece of garbage, and don't buy from best buy, they should call themselves worst buy. zip customer service, zero percent. avoid acer and best buy and you will save yourself a lot aggravations.
74	0	1	i use this laptop for school and it is great!  it's very small and ultra-portable, so i can use it anywhere.  it's fast enough for all the applications i use for school, and it works great for surfing the internet.  the small screen isn't too bad, you can zoom in on anything you want, and the keyboard is easy to get used to.  the only thing about this computer that i don't love is the battery life.  i have the 3 cell battery and it's only good for about 1.5-2 hours.  i got an extra charger for it so i just plug it in at school.  i have a blue one, and the case gets fingerprints on it easily.  other than those 2 minor drawbacks, i love my laptop!
75	0	1	i bought this thinking it will be neat to have and have fallen in love with it.  i don't really like the 15.4" notebooks due to size and weight, so i've been looking into getting a netbook.  i found this on sale and grabbed it.  the performance is nice for it's size and will be great for watching movies at work.  i removed alot of the preinstalled software and startup tasks and runs nice.  i have smaller hands and the keyboard is perfect.
76	0	1	great little notebook. keyboard is just perfect size.  i had mine booting 4 different oses: vista, xp, osx and ubuntu 8.04 using vista boot loader.  atom cpu is no workhorse but has enough power to handle most tasks.  3 cell battery lasts around 2.5 hrs in xp and 3hrs in vista.  construction feels very solid and it has a professional look, not a toy look like early asus minis.  pros: perfect keyboard, big shift keys shiny elegant finish bright screen 120 gb hard disk synaptics touchpad is great and very sensitive great for watching movies  cons: cover is a fingerprint magnet black bezel is easily scratched. fan runs often weird touchpad button location but it's easy to get used to them. memory upgrade and modifications are complex, requiring full disassembly  just sold my blue aspire one and got a onyx black with 6 cell battery... nice!
77	0	1	i had a wretched experience with the hp 2133.  i mentioned in the amazon review of it (which i had no idea would end up all over the 'net,  tons of other sites are pilfering and posting these reviews)  that i had bought an acer aspire one.  i like toys,  i gave away the asus when i bought the hp 2133.  to complete the story:  i've taken the acer on road trips,  occasionally used it at home.  it's small,  the keyboard is barely big enough for touch typing, but,  barely is enough.  i'm half deaf,  if the fan rattles i never hear it.  i'm used to the sony vaio, so i'm thrilled with 2.5 hours battery.  after stripping almost all the startup programs with msconfig,  boot is much faster.  we bought new office machines with vista when it was first released,  xp on the acer is an old friend ... one i'd missed.  the 120gig hd version wasn't priced much higher than the computer with the smaller flash memory,  although the hd is more likely to be busted if dropped.  i'm taking the chance.  all i want from a road-warrior notebook is internet,  some word processing,  occasionally a powerpoint.  i don't crunch major spreadsheets,  do graphics or edit video on the road. i don't much care which processor it has, all i want is basic functionality,  reliability, with no surprises or drama.  i want the wireless to work every time i turn the computer on.  i expect the os to boot up in a minute or so.  the acer delivers.  it doesn't hurt that it cost $349.  it gets my no-reservations vote.  it's the rare combination of ingredients that's worth more than the cost.
78	0	1	after 3 weeks, so far great performance and works as or better than expected. xp definitely outperforms the linux version i saw at best buy (who btw never seemed to have any machines in stock ever)if weight of a laptop and moderate,non-graphic intensive computing is your forte' this could be your road machine, or at least an around town box.
79	0	1	after 4 weeks of use, here's what i've found.  pros:  light weight  low cost  decent battery life  windows xp  multi-monitor support  cons:  backup windows cd not included/not available (the documentation on the acer sight said to burn a cd using the erecovery software on the computer.  the erecovery software is present, but it doesn't have that option.  the acer sight offers a cd for $20, but i heard that they send you the linux cd, not the windows xp cd.)  loud cooling fan (sometimes).  flickering led backlight during hard drive access if brightness is turned down.  touchpad buttons are a bit stiff (though they loosen up with a little use).  documentation (it took me a while to figure out the multi-touch touchpad was causing me to accidentally change the text size in internet explorer.  i still haven't gotten the hang of using the touchpad to scroll a scrollbar.  sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.)
80	0	1	i love the portability. and the size of the keyboard keys makes it very comfortable to use for longer periods. delivers what it promises.
81	0	1	this is a neat little computer which fits in my handbag so it is very easy to take with me whenever i want!  when i am meeting friends for lunch etc., and have to wait on them i can bring along my computer to use while i wait.  very pleased with it and also pleased with my service from amazon.
82	0	1	i had this little guy for about 2 weeks now and i must say this is the coolest little computer that i ever owned.  the specs are pretty impressive. comes with a 120 gig hard drive of which a 100 will be available to you. the rest is an invisible restore partition. that is plenty of space to work with for an xp home operating system. comes with 1 gig of ram. more than sufficient for running xp. with vista it is a different story. you can upgrade the ram if need be but it is a complicated process. if you are like me..using the notebook for email, pictures and streaming content..1 gig is more than sufficient. the atom processor is quite apt for this tiny guy. it handles most daily processes with relative ease without putting out a ton of heat. the 3 cell battery lasts about 2 and 1/2 hours under normal use. make sure to turn down the lcd brightness. some people have complained about the loud fan, but my experience is , unless you are listening for it, you will not be bothered. the wifi radio is a breeze. very sensitive to pick up access points and quick to connect. my guy has never dropped a connection yet. the keyboard is slightly tricky at first but you will get used to it.  viewing webpages is a slight challenge. you will have to be constantly scrolling down. on the ie 7, make sure you do away with the menubar and the toolbars to give the bowser maximum possible viewing area. the view is better at a 75% zoom level but you will need really good eyes to read.  the aspire one dose not have an optical drive to read cd's or dvd's. to load programs or drivers you have one of 2 options. directly from the net or via the network. (on your home network)share the cd or dvd drive on your desktop pc . now map it as a network drive on the aspire one. pop the cd in the optical drive of your desktop and access it from the aspire one.  also missing is the bluetooth radio. the easy way is to get a tiny usb bluetooth adapter off ebay. the smallest ones just stick about half and inch out. make sure they come with the drivers. windows has its own bt stack but very basic. if you are want it to connect to headphones to listen to music etc, you will need specialized drivers. ivt bluesoleil is a pretty good stack and i have used it for few years without issues. make sure the bt adapter ships with drivers. my adpater is permanently plugged in to one of my usb ports. it slips into the provided pouch, no problem with the usb bt attached.  screen is pretty bright and webcam is fair to use for yahoo,skype etc.  the case is a fingerprint magnet. make sure you do not touch the screen unless you want to leave prints all over. a good wipedown with a soft cloth may be in order from time to time. it is ultra portable, super light weight..you probably get the picture.  other than that, regular maintainence like cleaning the temp files, defraging etc will keep it running like new.
83	0	1	the acer screen is the best x-mas present i ever purchased!  great price and great product!  my mother loves it!
84	0	1	bought this beautiful little acer monitor and have been very happy with it... until it started interfering with my mac's wi-fi reception.  i cannot receive any wi-fi signal on airport while the monitor is plugged into the mac. i've tested and re-tested... it's the monitor. otherwise, an excellent value for the money. *update* this problem can be fixed by setting the channel on your wi-fi router to 1.
85	0	1	great monitor for a good price.  easy to set up with easy to reach configuration buttons.
86	0	1	the wide screen sloops down without the chance of adjusting. this was not acceptable so i returned the item.
87	0	1	everything is exactlly as advertised except i don't remember reading that it wasn't a tilt screen. so if you don't have it at the right level its really brite or very shady
88	0	1	inexpensive, great view, and no problems with setup. i plugged it in and it worked without a hitch. bought two at this price, and would definitely buy again.

90	0	1	i think this is good monitor for the $$. so far it works fine with good picture quality.
91	0	1	great monitor with an excellant price. i already had one so i bought another to match. does what i need it to do. good graphics and the whole transaction through amazon was 5 stars again. thanks again fro another great product.
92	0	1	i decided to return this monitor for a few reasons.  mainly because the screen was too bright and hurt my eyes.  my daughter totally agreed.  i even went into the settings and lowered the brightness and contrast down to zero.  that made it bearable, but the clarity and colors suffered some because of it.  (i know, i know, one would think that zero would be an all dark screen but not so with this monitor!)  i don't know if it was just the monitor i got or if all of them are that way.  i did notice others saying that their screens were bright.  also, i hated the controls and they were very frustrating to figure out.  it did not come with any instructions at all which i thought was strange.  and last of all, it was a 1440 x 900 and i could not find a decent setting that would work for me.  i like to change the size so the text is easier to read.  but this monitor could not handle a larger setting, the letters were half gray and smeared making it too difficult to even read.  when i returned this monitor i thought about trying another acer, hoping that the brightness and controls may be different.  i decided to go to staples and look at the 20" acer that was on sale there, but when i got there i saw that it had a glare screen.  that would never work for me because i have windows in the room.  but while i was there i decided to get their dell 20" monitor and i love it!  it is a 1600 x 900 and can handle a larger setting just fine.
93	0	1	the lcd in this monitor is very bright, and very shiny.  if you decrease the brightness to a reasonable level, the mirror-like surface will reflect any light sources that are behind you.  i suppose that bright, shiny monitors have good retail sales, because they are so eye-catching in the store.  but for usability, you're better off with an antiglare surface and moderate brightness.  the fhd2401 has very limited physical adjustability: you can adjust the tilt, down about 15 degrees and up about 40 degrees.  that's all.  it's the first lcd screen i've seen in 5 years that couldn't be adjusted up and down.  and you can just forget about pivoting the screen to portrait mode.  as other reviewers have noted, there is horrific backlight leakage around the edges of the screen.  this is especially bothersome when viewing full-screen videos.  i know gateway can make a better 24-inch monitor, because i've owned one: the discontinued fpd2485w.  it had a low-glare screen.  it could be moved up and down.  it was easy to rotate left or right.  and it could be pivoted between portrait and landscape.  it had a built-in usb hub, and accepted composite, s-video, and component inputs, none of which are available in the fhd2401.  so why am i using the mediocre fhd2401?  because gateway sent it as an in-warranty replacement for my fpd2485w.  i would much rather have a refurbished fpd2485w, but gateway gave me no choice.  it's really too bad that they've cut back on the features and quality of their monitors.
94	0	1	bought this, brand new from bestbuy almost 2 years ago. first off, my room is small. in a livingroom, no less than samsung for size+resolution. for my room, (or anyone at a desk-think distance x resolution-this thing is/was well worth the $650+ i paid. nothings perfect. low view angle means greys as mentioned. hdmi, dvi, component, composite, s-video, vga...optional speaker bar. this is my tv, runs samsung upconverting dvd player thru component, ps3 thru hdmi, any old game system thru composite (ugly, raw, how it was made-n64,snes-ps1-nes, etc) gamecube thru s-video...next plan is dvi to computer tower (for pip) & vga to gateway laptop. all that plus raise it & tilt for portrait mode...web pages in vertical widescreen...touch controls...worth more than i paid. now its under $300!? ill buy two more for wider pc view! long live gateway, first pc i used in highschool lol
95	0	1	i've owned a 24" gateway monitor for over a year now. it has worked well but there are problems that make me want to stay away from gateway in the future. first of all the monitor has a glossy face, it is very reflective and a pain. when you turned on the monitor, it plays a little tune which eventually becomes obnoxious. the final problem is that every time i turn it and my computer on, a box comes up asking me what language i want to work in. every single time! to dismiss the box you have to touch the button next to your language. like today i want to work in french or japanese? there is no way that i can see to turn this feature off. about a month ago i contacted tech support to ask them how to turn off the language box. they replied that my monitor was out of warranty. it's not a warranty issue and that was a bad response! i will never buy another gateway product. one final point that pushed me into buying a samsung 23", which is great. when i would put my computer into sleep mode and then turn it back on, the gateway monitor usually would not come on showing the computer; just snow. i would have to put the computer to sleep and wake it up several times before the gateway would figure it out and show the computer. a pain in the neck. the samsung comes on just fine first time, every time.
96	0	1	for a monitor that cost little it's very good.  it does have some minor problems such as the grays and pixal drift.  it also has some viewing angle probelms where colors are slightly distorted.  i use this monitor for photo editing so i'm more picky than most people.  for me these probelms do not effecit my ability to edit photos.  in the next couple of years i'll probably get an apple monitor and then after that a eizo.  but this is a good starting point imho.

98	0	1	this monitor has a lot of mixed reviews over the internet, but there seems to be a common issue with color banding and poor light grays that i noticed myself which ultimately caused me to return it in favor of the new samsung 2233rz.  the store where i purchased this at still has this monitor for $[...] which is the same price as the new samsung, but you can certainly find it cheaper over the net, and refurbed for around $[...] right now at compusa.  i will admit that i miss the presence this monitor brought to my computer area though.  it is a very bright and beautiful monitor, and i loved the touch menu capabilities.  if i only used my computer for internet browsing and watching hulu shows, then i would still have this monitor today.  unfortunately the gamer inside me yearns for visual perfection in colors and detail, and not to mention that i overpaid at the store for this particular unit.  bottom line: great bright display perfect for moderate use which plenty of inputs, but if you're a gamer with a fickle eye for detail then you'll want to look elsewhere.
99	0	1	well all i can tell you is wow.......once i connected this monitor to my new gateway computer...and hooked it up via my hdmi cable......this monitor is full 1080p.....and can be used as a tv on your computer if properly hooked up.. i must say that so far i am very impressed by the clarity beautiful color and sharpness of this monitor...its a pleasure to use it......
100	0	1	i purchased this just for my computer so i can't comment on hdmi or pip.  for a computer the display is amazing! it is unbelievably bright and spot-on sharp, the colors absolutely blow my old monitor away. without any height adjustment i had to put it up on a book but its working fine.  positives: fantastic display, my desktop is so huge! no display artifacts or ghosting problems, nothing bad to report. i haven't tried hdmi, but dvi and vga work great.  negatives: its actually too bright! sounds dumb but when looking at a white background (i.e. mail, word, google reader) its like staring at a light bulb. i have it adjusted down to 17% brightness at the moment because the amazon website has a white background.  one dead pixel in corner, not going to bother replacing it. it started up with hdmi as the selected input and i had to manually change it - most monitors auto-select, but that was not a big deal to me.
101	0	1	had to return my first 24" monitor because it had a dead red pixel, that cost $36 for shipping. the replacement 24" monitor has a dead blue pixel, i'm keeping this one i don't want to spend another $36 for shipping.  maybe thats what gateway's intention was, or j&r computer world was shipped all the dead pixeled 24" gatway monitors to pass on to us, the consumer.
102	0	1	when choosing a monitor, there's really 2 things i look at immediately before i begin to compare: price and picture quality.  i've never purchased a monitor without actually going into a store and looking them over myself.  however, for the fhd2401, i took a risk and purchased the monitor without seeing it first--simply said, the price was too low to pass up.  i actually got a refurbished monitor for only $250.  because of the low price, i wasn't expecting too great of a thing, but the specs sure had me impressed.  not only was i able to hook literally anything up (minus a cable input...), but the technical specs were nice too.  3ms refresh, 1920x1200, swivel mount, picture-in-picture, and 92% gamut... not bad at all.  when the monitor was finally delivered, i was able to see how well it actually performed.  i can't lie, the biggest downfall of the panel is the picture.  not to say it's terrible, but there are a few things many people will notice.  right away i saw a bit of backlight bleed around the edges of the screen.  also, the factory color calibration was terrible.  also, but up to individual preference, the screen is glossy.  i am a graphic artist and this monitor will never touch a serious project because it's not matte.  but for playing and surfing, glossy is better in my opinion--as long as there's not a lot of glare.  fortunately, manual calibration was fairly simple.  the menu has a few options (not as many as i'd hoped) for calibration, but combined with my gpu's settings, i was able to use a few tools to fine tune it with good results.  it's also great to have an on-board 4 port usb hub built in.  with the amount of peripherals i have, it's nice to keep some accessible up front while cutting down on the cable spaghetti i have behind my tower.  overall i find the monitor an excellent choice for the price.  don't expect professional level visuals, but for the regular user wanting more real estate, this is a fine choice.  i'm definitely satisfied with my purchase.
103	0	1	its an okay computer, but it was more trouble than it was worth.
104	0	1	as long as the power supply lasts, it is a workable computer  *****beware...if your power supply becomes defective, it does not appear there is a replacement part.  i even contacted acer and was advised they do not have the part.  .
105	0	1	if you want to read a review about this product i have owned mine for over a year now.  this has been a great computer with no problems. i love it because of all the memory(4gb) it has so it runs very fast and smooth even with 4900 songs stored on it and every other programs we have stored. the only thing that made me score it 4 stars over 5 is the speakers sound very cheap. keep your old speakers. i am a contractor so i carry them with me to job sites and hook them up to my mp3 player as work speakers. i would without thinking go out and buy this computer again if needed and from amazon. i paid from best buy $479.00 for this unit so this is a good deal and very much worth it.  i hope this reveiw helps someone out there. remember that if someone bought it for a day and returned it may not mean that its bad but maybe they don't know how to work it or set things up.(no dig on anyone) i always try and read the reviews from someone who has had a product for more than a month.
106	0	1	the computer never worked.  acer support contact is almost non existent and i had to do a web search with the computer i was replacing(dell)to find a number to acer. i returned the computer for a refund and bought another dell that is working perfectly.  no problem with the return or the refund from the vendor and amazon.
107	0	1	my acer netbook was a very tough thing to live with with its paltry oe 3-cell battery. its lack of meaningful charge life made portable life with the acer hardly portable at all; it was too often tied to some power adapter either to 120v or to the car battery just to give the little laptop enough juice for reasonable usability.  that all changed when the cursed panasonic-sourced 3-cell gladly died after 6 months and i ordered this oe 6-cell instead. finally, the little acer was powerful enough to be untethered with any amount of confidence that the netbook will have the power to back me. while no li-ion solution can ever be completely free from a wall wart or other charging source, this battery does make mobility with my netbook incredibly more fulfilling. i'm no longer having to worry about the battery level after only an hour or so of use; for instance, i can feel confident in using the acer as a portable companion with my nikon d300, something that was previously oh so tenuous when i was too far away from my car or other power source. and of course i can be more free to leave the power adapter behind when i'm out and about.  while there are cheaper 3rd-party cells around, i chose the oe option if only because of piece-of-mind with possible compatibility issues. acer now ships 6-cell batteries (presumably this one) as standard with their netbooks; that's a good enough endorsement for me.
108	0	1	nice monitor for the price.  acer is a brand we've been well satisfied with.
109	0	1	ordered two of these, one for my mother and one for an extra pc here that my wife uses primarily.  lacking technical specs i wasn't sure if this had vga and dvi, or just vga inputs.  once it arrived i did notice it only had a vga, but in use it seems to be more than crisp enough, and at this resolution vga should be adequate for the length of the cable provided with the unit.  i have several other higher end lcds that i use for my work here for comparison, and this one compares just fine.  like most lcds its factory settings are entirely too bright for the subdued lighting inside of my office, but choosing the text or internet setting as a starting point (i forget which now) i dialed it in a bit more by hand to keep eye-strain down and readability of web-pages and email up.  the only minor complaint i have is that the unit generates a small amount of noise when on, probably the transformer for the cfl tubes (or the tubes themselves).  my wife and mother can't tell the difference so there's no real issue there, but i wouldn't choose to use this at my desk as i am rather sensitive to even quiet noises when exposed to them day after day.  the internal speakers might be a bonus for office/secretarial type duties as a space/cost savings, but in normal desktop use even $15 speakers usually sound better than any lcd, and i tend to think not using internal speakers will extend the life of the cfl backlighting by avoiding subjecting them to the internal vibrations.  however i've only had 1 cfl backlight in an lcd fail to date, and in that case it was manufacturing error, so take my opinions for what they are (purely subjective).
110	0	1	no problems with this monitor. my only complaint is that the speakers are very weak.
111	0	1	monitor works well, audio from this monitor is right up there with an am transistor radio.  still, for the money it's ok.
112	0	1	great colors, sharp definition, & easy to install.  sound quality is poor, however.
113	0	1	after reading reviews on several monitors i decided on this one. it is really nice and plenty big for these tired, old eyes.  very pleased with this product.
114	0	1	i have had this computer for about three years.  the computer case is fully upgradeable which is a plus.  i keep this computer at my mom's house so i can use windows there.  the main issue i had with the computer was the power supply that comes with the computer is not powerful enough to power the computer.  this causes the computer to not respond from time to time.  which this computer you must upgrade the power supply right away. once the power supply is upgraded, the computer works like a charm.
115	0	1	for it's time, one of the best netbooks around.
116	0	1	good laptop
117	0	1	thanks so much for the item, im so happy with it and hope to get more item later. appreciate it.
118	0	1	excellent product, it is quite comfortable to work and transport, its performance is fast until you have many applications open simultaneously, conmuchas open applications performance is very low
119	0	1	i bought this for my son 2 years ago and he uses it every day at work, he is a salesman and he keeps all his accounts on it and does market research on his products.
120	0	1	this netbook has the battery life of only 2-3 hours. otherwise a good machine for xp.
121	0	1	i bought this mini laptop for my 9 year old son.  he loves it and works well for playing internet games.
122	0	1	like the mini laptop so far. fits in my small timbuk2 bag nicely. only problem so far is the office 2007 trial software installed. have not figured out how to remove it and just use word 2003.  did load openoffice on it though so i won't lose my work when the trial runs out.  keyboard is large enough, screen is a little small.
123	0	1	i thought it would be neat. it is cute, but, you have to have an external cd rom and i couldn't get one to work after spending another $90 for that. then it just started to squeal and i couldn't use it.  had to return. would not order another one.
124	0	1	dear consumer.  i bought it since november 2008, i love it becuase of the size but it is not funtional at all becuase the keepboard size netbook has, the other facilities like weight, color and have everything in one place it is great, even i have a dell computer lapto latitud, but not i let it at home and came out to work with my accer just, of course i did not charge anything there, just use to work out and carry the file i need.  when people saw my one most of them move to buy one because it is funtionality at the end.
125	0	1	this computer was good for the price when i bought it around 4-5 years ago for 550 bucks at walmart. the face plate was loose and would not snap back into place so i ripped it off. after some modifications and ripping it apart, which as somebody how had never done that before it came apart pretty easily. i took the whole computer apart and cleaned it last month and replaced the heat sink gel and cleaned the heatsink which does collect dust like crazy. but what can you expect after 5 years of use. i disconnected the modem with the phone jack and removed the dvd rom drive because i do not use them. i also removed the outer case and use the computer as an open unit with the internal hard drive just laying their. it is quite loud in the container case, but now that it is resting on the unit it is quiet as a kitten. i also added a new graphics card, the msi gt210. it doesn't fit, but with an open case it does fit but the heat sink does sit outside the units case. works like a charm and is much better than the integrated graphics card, which is horrible. the msi gt210 makes the computer so much faster with playing hd video and games. i don't recommend this computer to a novice user, but for somebody like me who likes to tinker i have this machine running super fast. i also have a 1tb external hard drive for almost unlimited space for file storage. the computer does sometimes have sound issues, but i fixed that. i would recommend a wireless wifi usb adapter for wireless internet. mine works great.
126	0	1	this is a decent pc. with 4gb's of ram, a 2.4ghz dual core amd cpu, and an integrated 8600 nvidea geforce graphics card... i can do most things with this. i am a web developer, so i do a lot of scripting on this machine, as well as running my web server off her. i also use this machine for social networking, youtube, san andreas: multiplayer, counter strike: source, g-mod, and minecraft, all of which this computer is able to run fast! i have run simcity 4 in the past on this machine, runs very smooth with absolutely no problems! i own a copy of grand theft auto: 4... this machine will not run that due to the lack of capacity in the video card! i assume that this machine would not be able to play any similar newer games.  really, the only thing i have found to be a set-back with this machine is the 320gb hdd which i tend to fill up quickly. i'm debating buying a larger hdd or just buying a new computer. either way, this computer has been great for me! not to mention, the quality of and deal i got with the machine was a true steal! the computer came with a 22" flatt-screen monitor, a mouse, a keyboard, and speakers! all for around $400! not to mention, i bought this computer with windows vista installed, once windows 7 came out, acer had an operating system upgrade program going, where i was able to get a free windows 7 upgrade disk.  in a nutshell: this computer is great and can run mostly anything! it comes with everything you need to get started, at a steal! the only thing i would improve with this would be to jack up the size of it's measly 320gb hdd. this was certainly more than worth my money! i saved money buying this thing!!!
127	0	1	i've had this little computer for 3 months now without any problems. vista is annoying and i wish i could 'downgrade' to xp but that would 1/2 the 4gig of ram it came with so i'm stuck with vista. did not do the bios update the other reviewer was having problems with so can't comment on that. all in all a great, fast, light computer that is hooked to my hdtv for couch surfing and hulu video watching and its perfect for the task. oh, yea, and the price is right!
128	0	1	pros: small, quiet, powerful, attractive, inexpensive. probably the best deal around for a home theater personal computer (htpc).  cons:hdmi audio broken. problems with network adapter cutting in & out. built and "supported" by acer.  i bought this device the day i heard about it. i knew it was the perfect fit for my entertainment center as a home theater personal computer (htpc). got home, set it up and was just all around happy. one hdmi cable to attach to my tv and no hassle with choosing resolutions (1080p) or anything. set it so that vista media center starts at windows start-up and attached a remote control. connected to my shared videos/mp3/pictures/etc across the network. there were a couple of network issues where it just stopped working and then started again.  however, this is when my problems started. i received an email from acer telling me about a bios update. then the acer update software started telling me that there was a bios update also. apparently, one of the things this update was supposed to fix was the network issues. so, i ran the bios update, rebooted windows and found out that i don't have any sound anymore. tried altering some settings, etc, but nothing seemed to work. i googled "acer x1200 hdmi audio" and came across people all with this same problem.  i called acer support (device is just over a month old at this point) and after about 45 minutes waiting i finally speak to someone that tells me to do a windows system restore, even though this won't change anything on the bios. the phone conversation was disconnected, so i wait for the representative to call me back, since we are in the middle of trying to help me. when this happened to me before with dell, they called back in a matter of minutes. needless to say, no one called me back. so about 30 mins later, i call support again, wait for about an hour and finally get through to someone else. i explain the situation to him and he starts chastising me about updating the bios and how no one should ever update the bios.  i then explain to him that i was notified 2 different ways by acer to update. needless to say, he shuts up and has no solution, except for me to have it shipped to them out of my own pocket to have it repaired. by repaired, i'm sure they mean reformatted, and not fixed. if it could be fixed, they would just release a bios update for everyone to use to fix their system themselves.  i guess i could live with this problem if it wasn't for the fact that i don't have any other inputs on my tv for sound other than hdmi. my other devices are using such connections. basically, i'm left with almost a brick.  also, there's a sticker that says "if removed, warranty void" covering access to inside the case. so, if you were planning on using that extra pcix slot, or upgrading to a bluray drive, or adding more ram, etc... you can forget about the warranty. but it would seem that that's not much of a loss judging by what i've seen of their customer care so far.  in short, this would be the perfect little htpc, but acer leaves a lot to be desired.
129	0	1	i bought acer aspire extensa 7620-4021, and it was working fine till , it crashed , i have to reinstall window vista and software drivers, but to my surprise there was none sent with the laptop. i was not very computer literate and realized this late that i needed installation cd and soft ware drivers to reinstall everything, this was told to me by tech. to whom i took computer to fix it.  now i am trying to get in touch with seller to send me the installtion cd and software drivers. i hope they are kind enough to help me with this ,and i will get back with you on this matter as follow up. if they don't send me the installation cd and software driver, i will loose the computer as piece of metal, after spending all my pocket money. pray for me, and make sure you get everything when you buy you computer  ahmed
